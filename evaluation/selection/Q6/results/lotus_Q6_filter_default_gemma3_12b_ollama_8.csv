He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double - double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster were n't able to limit him.

The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings.

Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals. The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.

28,28,4,"The Detroit Pistons (30 - 29) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (24 - 35) 102 - 91 on Saturday. In a battle of Eastern Conference Central Division rivals, the Pistons used timely three - point shooting and defense to gain an early advantage that they would n't relinquish. Even though Milwaukee outperformed them from beyond the arc by a margin of 58 percent to 40 percent, Detroit was able to nail six of their first seven three - point attempts, and 11 of their 19 overall in the first half. Their defense also elicited 21 turnovers from the Bucks, which they were able to convert into 23 points. On the offensive side, a strong outing from Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond's league - leading 50th double - double on the season helped lead the way for the visitors, carrying them to the road victory.

Tobias Harris and Drummond were next with a pair of 15 - point efforts.

38,38,5,"The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 118 - 101 Tuesday at BMO Harris Bradley Center. The Bucks (8 - 8) took advantage of a Cavaliers (13 - 3) team that looked disinterested from the second quarter on, as Milwaukee managed to open up a four - point lead at halftime and won the game with the help of a dominant third quarter, which they won 34 - 20. It got so out of hand in the third period that Cleveland head coach Tyronn Lue pulled all five of his starters who were on the court. The Bucks were led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who continues to put together an All-Star-caliber season. The Greek Freak scored a game - high 34 points on top of 12 rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocked shots. Fellow young star Jabari Parker posted 18 points of his own, while Michael Beasley had one of his best performances of the season off the bench, scoring 17 points. As a team, the Bucks put together one of their best shooting nights of the year, as they shot an astounding 54 percent from the floor. For the Cavaliers, it was one of their more uninspiring performances of the season, as they lacked much energy and settled for a lot of 3 - point shots. As a team, 39 of their 75 shots came from behind the arc. LeBron James led the way with 22 points, four rebounds and four assists, while Kyrie Irving added 20 points. Kevin Love was the only other Cavalier to score in double figures, as he posted a double - double of 13 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland had won four in a row and seven of their last eight before Tuesday night, however, and still sit comfortable as the top team in the Eastern Conference. Up next, the Bucks will head to Brooklyn on Thursday to take on the Nets, while the Cavaliers will go home Thursday and play the Clippers.
