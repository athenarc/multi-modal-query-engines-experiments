Dallas (20 - 30) has picked up steam in recent weeks after what was an abysmal start to the season. Friday's victory was marked by a breakout performance from D-League call - up Yogi Ferrell. Ferrell, who shot an astounding 9 - of - 11 from three - point range, scored a career - high 32 points to lead the Mavericks including a game - clinching three - pointer with under 30 seconds remaining. While Ferrell dropped jaws with his impressive play, wing Wesley Matthews also put together a stellar performance, scoring 27 points and coming away with six rebounds. As a whole, the team earned the win on the backs of strong three - point shooting. The Mavs shot an impressive 17 - of - 31 from beyond the arc. Portland (22 - 29), meanwhile, was let down by star point guard Damian Lillard. Lillard shot just 4 - of - 20 on the night in quite possibly his worst outing of the season. On the other hand, wing Evan Turner steped up for one of his best performances as a Blazer. Turner scored 24 points on 10 - of - 17 shooting. The Blazers held a rare advantage in the rebounding column, but were unable to shoot with nearly the efficiency of Dallas, ultimately ending in the loss. The Blazers will visit OKC on Sunday, while the Mavericks will visit Denver on Monday.

The Wizards have already dealt with the loss of an integral component for an extended stretch this season, and that experience is serving them well in the wake of the latest injury to a key cog of their team. Marcin Gortat is dealing with a series of knee complications that includes an infection, and has missed the last three games as a result. In his stead, Nene Hilario has stepped up with three solid performances, but multiple players elevated their respective games on the glass Friday to help make up for the big man's absence. The Wizards managed an outstanding 54 rebounds, including 37 on the defensive end. Meanwhile, Washington also shot a solid 52 percent from the field, and an equally impressive 44 percent from three - point range, leading to a relatively comfortable victory. John Wall spearheaded the Wizards' attack once again, posting a game - high 28 points and also tallying seven rebounds, eight assists and a steal. No other starter tallied double - digit scoring, but Hilario did match his eight points with eight boards, and added two assists, a steal and a block. Garrett Temple made another start in place of Beal, and contributed five points, six rebounds and five assists. However, Beal significantly outplayed him off the bench, posting 22 points, five rebounds and an assist over 22 minutes. DeJuan Blair and Gary Neal pitched in with a pair of 12 - point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals, and the latter managing four boards and three assists. Ramon Sessions was the fourth reserve with a double - digit point total, stuffing the stat sheet over 23 minutes with 10 points, five assists, three rebounds and two steals. The Wizards improved to 19 - 19 and currently reside in fourth place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They head to Boston to face the Celtics on Saturday. The Pacers were paced by Paul George, who tallied 21 points, seven assists, five rebounds, three steals and a block. George Hill, questionable before the game for personal reasons, played 34 minutes and posted 19 points, eight rebounds, an assist and a steal.

"report_14.txt","The Washington Wizards (36 - 37) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (15 - 58) 101 - 88 at Staples Center on Sunday. Washington ended a short, but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road, and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards played at a high speed pace, led by John Wall, who diced through the Lakers defense and took advantage of his matchup with D’Angelo Russell. Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own. Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game. Bryant finished with 17 points, one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting, but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times, which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game. The Lakers will visit the Utah Jazz (36 - 37) on Monday, while the Wizards will head north to take on the Golden State Warriors (66 - 7).

Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals. The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.

It was n't the cleanest game ever played, with the Timberwolves handing out 23 turnovers and the Grizzlies racking up 17 of their own, but it was still a tight matchup that ended with a close finish. Marc Gasol put the Grizzlies on his back and helped the Grizzlies get their first victory of the year.

Mike Conley also passed the double - digit benchmark and finished with 16 points to go along with one rebound, six assists, and a steal. The other starting guard, Courtney Lee, shot 5 - for - 11 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from behind the arc to score 14 points in 35 minutes of action. Despite the win, the Grizzlies got little output from their bench unit, who only scored 10 of their 105 total points. With a ton of fresh faces, this was finally a shot for Timberwolves' fans to see their new young lineup. Thaddeus Young was very efficient in his debut, scoring 26 points (10 - 18 FG, 2 - 3 3PT, 4 - 4 FT) and grabbing four rebounds, four assists, and two steals. Mo Williams matched Young's efficiency and added 18 points (6 - 9 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) of his own. Williams also contributed four assists and a steal. No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins made his regular season debut but only had six points, three rebounds, an assist, and two steals, playing just 18 minutes. The Grizzlies' next game is on the road Friday against the Indiana Pacers, while the Timberwolves will take on the Detroit Pistons on Thursday in Detroit.
