Since I don't have direct access to such databases and the information isn't provided here, I'll guide you through how one might approach this task with hypothetical data.

Let's assume we have a table named ""Players"" with columns for ""player_name"" and ""birthdate"". The ""birthdate"" column would contain dates in a format that can be easily converted or is already in the desired format (DD/MM/YYYY).

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Connect to the Database**: Establish a connection to your database using SQL or any programming language like Python with libraries such as `sqlite3` for SQLite, `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, etc.

2. **Query the Database**: Write a SQL query to select the birthdate of each player from the ""Players"" table where the ""player_name"" matches the given names. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT birthdate FROM Players WHERE player_name = 'Ed Davis'"

Please note that these dates might not be accurate or up-to-date, as they are based on my training data. For precise information, it's always best to consult the original source or database."

"Marcus Thornton","To answer this question, I would need access to a database containing the birthdates of basketball players. Since I don't have direct access to such databases, I'll provide a general approach on how one might solve this using hypothetical data.

Assuming there's a table named ""Players"" with columns for ""player_name"" and ""birthdate"", you could query this information directly from the database. However, without actual database access or specific birthdate information for these players, I can only demonstrate the logic:

1. Connect to the database.
2. Query the ""Players"" table for the ""birthdate"" where ""player_name"" matches each of the given names.
3. Format the retrieved birthdates into ""DD/MM/YYYY"" format.

Given the lack of specific data and direct database access, let's proceed with what we know about these players from public knowledge (which might not be up-to-date or accurate):

- Lance Stephenson: Born August 5, 1990
- Lance Thomas: Born April 24, 1988
- Landry Fields: Born June 27, 1988
- Langston Galloway: Born December 9, 1991
- Larry Drew II: Born March 5, 1990

Thus, the formatted answer based on publicly available information would be:

Assuming there's a table named ""Players"" with columns for ""player_name"" and ""birthdate"", the SQL query to extract the birthdate in the format DD/MM/YYYY for each player could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(birthdate, '%d/%m/%Y') AS formatted_birthdate
FROM 
    Players
WHERE 
    player_name IN ('Jordan Adams', 'Jordan Clarkson', 'Jordan Crawford', 'Jordan Farmar', 'Jordan Hamilton')"

"Damjan Rudez","To answer this question, I would need access to the actual database or a list of player birthdates. Since that information is not provided here, I'll guide you through a general approach on how to solve it, assuming you have access to the necessary data.

1. **Identify the Source**: The source column is ""Players"".""player_name"", which implies we are looking for birthdates associated with each player's name in this column.

2. **Access Birthdate Information**: You would need a database or table that maps player names to their respective birthdates. This could be another column in the ""Players"" table or an entirely different table/database that you can join or query based on the player's name.

3. **Format the Birthdate**: Once you have the birthdate for each player, you would need to format it as DD/MM/YYYY if it's not already in this format. The exact method to do this depends on the database system you're using (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and how the date is currently stored.

Given the lack of specific data or a database schema, let's simulate an answer based on hypothetical birthdates for these players:

- Damien Inglis: 20/05/1995
- Damjan Rudez: 17/06/1986
- Danilo Gallinari: 08/08/1988
- Danny Granger: 20/04/1983
- Danny Green: 22/06/1987

"James Anderson","To answer this question, I would need access to the actual database or a provided dataset that includes the birthdates of the players. However, since I don't have direct access to such databases and for the purpose of providing an example response based on publicly available information (which might not be up-to-date or accurate), let's proceed with what is generally known.

Given the names:
1. JaKarr Sampson
2. JaMychal Green
3. JaVale McGee
4. Jabari Brown
5. Jabari Parker

And assuming we have their birthdates (please note these are real players, but without direct access to a database, I'll provide what can be found publicly):

1. JaKarr Sampson - Born March 20, 1993
2. JaMychal Green - Born June 21, 1990
3. JaVale McGee - Born January 19, 1988
4. Jabari Brown - Born December 18, 1992
5. Jabari Parker - Born March 15, 1995

The formatted birthdates would be:
20/03/1993"
"Jared Sullinger","20/03/1980"
"Dante Cunningham"," 22/06/1987

Please note, the actual birthdates might differ and should be verified against accurate data sources."

"Jordan Farmar","To answer this question, I would need access to a database containing the birthdates of basketball players. Since I don't have direct access to such databases, I'll provide a general approach on how one might solve this using hypothetical data.

Assuming there's a table named ""Players"" with columns for ""player_name"" and ""birthdate"", you could query this information using SQL or another database querying language. The exact method would depend on the structure of your database and the tools you're using to access it.

Given the names:
1. John Henson
2. John Jenkins
3. John Lucas III
4. John Wall
5. Johnny O'Bryant III

1. John Henson - July 28, 1990
2. John Jenkins - March 6, 1991
3. John Lucas III - November 21, 1982
4. John Wall - September 6, 1990
5. Johnny O'Bryant III - June 1, 1993

Assuming there's a database table named ""Players"" with columns for ""player_name"" and ""birthdate"", the SQL query to extract the birthdate in the format DD/MM/YYYY for each given player name would look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdate, '%d/%m/%Y') 
FROM Players 
WHERE player_name IN ('Jason Richardson', 'Jason Smith', 'Jason Terry', 'Jason Thompson', 'Jaylen Brown')"

"Udonis Haslem","To answer this question, I would need access to the actual database or a list of birthdates for NBA players. However, based on publicly available information, here are the birthdates for each player in the format DD/MM/YYYY:


28/02/1980"

"Bryce Cotton","01/04/1988"
"Jerryd Bayless","21/07/1986"
"Enes Kanter","
    ```

    You would need to run this query for each player, replacing `'Ed Davis'` with the respective name.

3. **Format the Birthdate**: Ensure the birthdate is in the format DD/MM/YYYY. If it's not, you might need to convert it using SQL functions like `DATE_FORMAT()` in MySQL or `TO_CHAR()` in PostgreSQL.

    For example, in MySQL:
    ```sql
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdate, '%d/%m/%Y') FROM Players WHERE player_name = 'Ed Davis'"
"Jannero Pargo","07/03/1994"
"Chris Kaman"," 17/07/1985"
"Langston Galloway"," 12/08/1991


Please note that these dates might not be up-to-date or accurate, and it's always best to verify information through official sources."
