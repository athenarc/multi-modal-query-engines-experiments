It got so out of hand in the third period that Cleveland head coach Tyronn Lue pulled all five of his starters who were on the court. The Bucks were led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who continues to put together an All-Star-caliber season. The Greek Freak scored a game - high 34 points on top of 12 rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocked shots. Fellow young star Jabari Parker posted 18 points of his own, while Michael Beasley had one of his best performances of the season off the bench, scoring 17 points. As a team, the Bucks put together one of their best shooting nights of the year, as they shot an astounding 54 percent from the floor. For the Cavaliers, it was one of their more uninspiring performances of the season, as they lacked much energy and settled for a lot of 3 - point shots. As a team, 39 of their 75 shots came from behind the arc. LeBron James led the way with 22 points, four rebounds and four assists, while Kyrie Irving added 20 points. Kevin Love was the only other Cavalier to score in double figures, as he posted a double - double of 13 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland had won four in a row and seven of their last eight before Tuesday night, however, and still sit comfortable as the top team in the Eastern Conference. Up next, the Bucks will head to Brooklyn on Thursday to take on the Nets, while the Cavaliers will go home Thursday and play the Clippers.

Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings.

It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward.

Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals.

Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.
