The game was a tale of two halves, as these teams showed why they have struggled so much this season. The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead, but blew it in the second half with some bad defense. The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game. The one bright spot was the bench, as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together. Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game. This was a brutal loss for Nuggets fans and they'll look to bounce - back on Wednesday when they take on the Phoenix Suns.

It was n't the cleanest game ever played, with the Timberwolves handing out 23 turnovers and the Grizzlies racking up 17 of their own, but it was still a tight matchup that ended with a close finish. Marc Gasol put the Grizzlies on his back and helped the Grizzlies get their first victory of the year. Gasol finished the game with 32 points (12 - 17 FG), nine rebounds, three assists, two steals, and two blocked shots, getting a little bit of everything on the stat sheet Wednesday. Not far behind was Zach Randolph, who had 25 points (12 - 16 FG), 13 rebounds, an assist, and a block. Mike Conley also passed the double - digit benchmark and finished with 16 points to go along with one rebound, six assists, and a steal. The other starting guard, Courtney Lee, shot 5 - for - 11 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from behind the arc to score 14 points in 35 minutes of action. Despite the win, the Grizzlies got little output from their bench unit, who only scored 10 of their 105 total points. With a ton of fresh faces, this was finally a shot for Timberwolves' fans to see their new young lineup. Thaddeus Young was very efficient in his debut, scoring 26 points (10 - 18 FG, 2 - 3 3PT, 4 - 4 FT) and grabbing four rebounds, four assists, and two steals. Mo Williams matched Young's efficiency and added 18 points (6 - 9 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) of his own. Williams also contributed four assists and a steal.

In a battle of Eastern Conference Central Division rivals, the Pistons used timely three - point shooting and defense to gain an early advantage that they would n't relinquish. Even though Milwaukee outperformed them from beyond the arc by a margin of 58 percent to 40 percent, Detroit was able to nail six of their first seven three - point attempts, and 11 of their 19 overall in the first half. Their defense also elicited 21 turnovers from the Bucks, which they were able to convert into 23 points. On the offensive side, a strong outing from Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond's league - leading 50th double - double on the season helped lead the way for the visitors, carrying them to the road victory. Jackson paced the Pistons' attack with 22 points, eight assists, two rebounds and two steals. Marcus Morris followed with 20 points, eight rebounds and two assists. Tobias Harris and Drummond were next with a pair of 15 - point efforts. The former added four rebounds, four assists and a steal, while the latter hauled in 17 boards, dished out two assists, recorded four steals and registered a pair of blocks. The Pistons remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division, and just a half - game back of the eighth - seeded Chicago Bulls. They head home to face off with the Toronto Raptors on Sunday. Milwaukee was led by Khris Middleton's 26 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Jabari Parker followed with 13 points, five rebounds and three assists. Miles Plumlee continued to start at center over Greg Monroe, and collected 10 points, six rebounds, a steal and two blocks. Monroe paced the reserves with 10 points, seven rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block, and outpaced Plumlee in minutes by a margin of 27 - 21.

The Thunder took advantage of their superior shooting in this one. They shot 50 percent from the field, compared to the Bucks who shot only 41 percent from the field. Despite turning the ball over 20 times, the Thunder were also able to out - rebound the Bucks 54 - 31, giving them enough of an advantage to sneak out the victory at home on Tuesday. The Thunder are thrilled to have both of their superstars back from injury as both Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook led the Thunder to the victory in this one. Westbrook had a team - high of 28 points (8 - 16 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt), while also handing out seven assists. He was able to get to the line at will, and converted on 12 - of - 15 attempts. He's now scored over 20 points in seven out of the eight games he's played this season, recording season averages of 24 points and 7 assists per game.

Mayo was the leading scorer on the other side for the Bucks, as he shot 6 - for - 13 from the field, but only 0 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 18 points. He eventually had to leave the game though, as he fouled out before the end of regulation. Giannis Antetokounmpo was also able to reach double figures with 17 points and seven rebounds. He did n't shoot all that well from the field (4 - 11 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but he was able to get to the free throw line 11 times and converted on eight of those attempts.

Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors.

Carmelo Anthony hauled in the defensive rebound off the missed shot, and following a Knicks timeout, Jose Calderon sealed the victory with a clutch 26 - foot three - point jumper with less than a second remaining. Anthony led the way for the Knicks with a 26 - point, 12 - rebound double - double, to which he added four assists and a block. Robin Lopez contributed 16 points, eight boards, two assists and two blocks. Derrick Williams, getting a spot start in place of the sidelined Kristaps Porzingis (illness), filled out the stat sheet with eight points, nine rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block.

Portland (22 - 29), meanwhile, was let down by star point guard Damian Lillard. Lillard shot just 4 - of - 20 on the night in quite possibly his worst outing of the season.

He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds.

The win, along with a Celtics win, leaves the Nets in a tie for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, but they are losing the tiebreaker to Boston. They currently hold a 2 - game lead over the Pacers for that position with just three games left to play in the regular season. The Wizards rested John Wall for the second night in a row, as they do not have much to play for as the season winds down. Bradley Beal played well in the losing effort, scoring a team - high 24 points (10 - 19 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt), while Marcin Gortat recorded a monster double - double of 21 points (9 - 11 FG) and 16 rebounds.

With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games.

While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one.

Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals. The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.
