It got so out of hand in the third period that Cleveland head coach Tyronn Lue pulled all five of his starters who were on the court. The Bucks were led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who continues to put together an All-Star-caliber season. The Greek Freak scored a game - high 34 points on top of 12 rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocked shots. Fellow young star Jabari Parker posted 18 points of his own, while Michael Beasley had one of his best performances of the season off the bench, scoring 17 points. As a team, the Bucks put together one of their best shooting nights of the year, as they shot an astounding 54 percent from the floor. For the Cavaliers, it was one of their more uninspiring performances of the season, as they lacked much energy and settled for a lot of 3 - point shots. As a team, 39 of their 75 shots came from behind the arc. LeBron James led the way with 22 points, four rebounds and four assists, while Kyrie Irving added 20 points. Kevin Love was the only other Cavalier to score in double figures, as he posted a double - double of 13 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland had won four in a row and seven of their last eight before Tuesday night, however, and still sit comfortable as the top team in the Eastern Conference. Up next, the Bucks will head to Brooklyn on Thursday to take on the Nets, while the Cavaliers will go home Thursday and play the Clippers.

44,6,LeBron James,"The second - seed Cleveland Cavaliers (40) completed their sweep of the seventh - seed Boston Celtics (0 - 4) in a 101 - 93 slugfest Sunday. Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

The Wizards managed an outstanding 54 rebounds, including 37 on the defensive end. Meanwhile, Washington also shot a solid 52 percent from the field, and an equally impressive 44 percent from three - point range, leading to a relatively comfortable victory. John Wall spearheaded the Wizards' attack once again, posting a game - high 28 points and also tallying seven rebounds, eight assists and a steal. No other starter tallied double - digit scoring, but Hilario did match his eight points with eight boards, and added two assists, a steal and a block. Garrett Temple made another start in place of Beal, and contributed five points, six rebounds and five assists. However, Beal significantly outplayed him off the bench, posting 22 points, five rebounds and an assist over 22 minutes. DeJuan Blair and Gary Neal pitched in with a pair of 12 - point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals, and the latter managing four boards and three assists. Ramon Sessions was the fourth reserve with a double - digit point total, stuffing the stat sheet over 23 minutes with 10 points, five assists, three rebounds and two steals. The Wizards improved to 19 - 19 and currently reside in fourth place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They head to Boston to face the Celtics on Saturday. The Pacers were paced by Paul George, who tallied 21 points, seven assists, five rebounds, three steals and a block. George Hill, questionable before the game for personal reasons, played 34 minutes and posted 19 points, eight rebounds, an assist and a steal.

While the spotlight largely and rightfully shone on that pair of remarkable efforts, Trey Burke also put together a notable performance while pacing the Jazz's bench, which included a 23 - foot three - point jumper with 13 seconds remaining in regulation that sent the game into its first extra period. Burke's key basket culiminated a 31 - 22 run by Utah in the fourth quarter to erase what had been a 73 - 64 deficit entering the period. After Rudy Gobert's dunk off a Hayward assist with seven seconds left in the first overtime tied things up at 108, Walker drained four free throws in the final minute of the sixth quarter to put a cap on what was a record - setting afternoon and send the Hornets to the locker room as weary victors. Hayward added nine assists, five rebounds, a pair of steals and a block to his team - high scoring total to pace the Jazz. Burke's memorable afternoon consisted of a season - high 25 points, along with three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Gobert put together a second straight impressive double - double, tallying 14 points, hauling in 14 boards, dishing out three assists, and recording a steal and two blocks. Trevor Booker also made a significant contribution off the bench with 12 points, eight rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. Utah fell to 18 - 23 and remains in second place in the Western Conference's Northwest Division. They head to New York to take on the Knicks on Wednesday. Walker almost added a triple - double to his spectacular afternoon, supplementing his eye - popping scoring numbers with nine rebounds and eight assists. He also threw in a pair of thefts. Marvin Williams was a distant second to him in scoring, but still turned in a solid effort with 19 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. Cody Zeller managed 14 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block, while Nicolas Batum was a rebound short of a double - double with 10 points, nine boards, four assists and a steal.

The 2015 Finals rematch featuring two of the very best in the NBA turned out to be more of a showcase for both teams' often underrated defenses. Neither squad was able to put on much of an offensive display, and the game had more of the feel of a grind - it - out Eastern Conference battle, rather than the free - wheeling, high - scoring affairs typically played by the reigning champs. The Warriors shot 41 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc, with both numbers notably lower than their respective 49 and 42 season figures in those categories. Cleveland fared even worse, draining only 32 percent of their buckets overall, including a paltry 17 percent from long range. Both teams' point totals were also season - low tallies, underscoring how formidable both defensive units can be against top - tier competition. The Cavs were led by Lebron James' game - high 25 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and a pair of blocks. Despite the solid scoring total, the perennial All-Star was one of the superstars struggling with his shot, sinking only 10 of his 26 attempts. J.R. Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Kevin Love helped spearhead Cleveland's outstanding team total of 55 rebounds on the evening by hauling in 18 boards, and pairing them with 10 points in his second straight double - double. Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting. However, the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds, seven assists and a pair of steals. The perpetually dependable Klay Thompson was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role, pitching in with 18 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Shaun Livingston was highly productive off the bench with a season - high 16 points, leading the Warriors' reserves. Golden State improved to 28 - 1 and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division, Western Conference and the entire NBA. They remain home for a date with the Sacramento Kings on Monday.

Neither squad was able to put on much of an offensive display, and the game had more of the feel of a grind - it - out Eastern Conference battle, rather than the free - wheeling, high - scoring affairs typically played by the reigning champs. The Warriors shot 41 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc, with both numbers notably lower than their respective 49 and 42 season figures in those categories. Cleveland fared even worse, draining only 32 percent of their buckets overall, including a paltry 17 percent from long range. Both teams' point totals were also season - low tallies, underscoring how formidable both defensive units can be against top - tier competition. The Cavs were led by Lebron James' game - high 25 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and a pair of blocks. Despite the solid scoring total, the perennial All-Star was one of the superstars struggling with his shot, sinking only 10 of his 26 attempts. J.R. Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Kevin Love helped spearhead Cleveland's outstanding team total of 55 rebounds on the evening by hauling in 18 boards, and pairing them with 10 points in his second straight double - double. Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting. However, the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds, seven assists and a pair of steals. The perpetually dependable Klay Thompson was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role, pitching in with 18 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Shaun Livingston was highly productive off the bench with a season - high 16 points, leading the Warriors' reserves. Golden State improved to 28 - 1 and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division, Western Conference and the entire NBA. They remain home for a date with the Sacramento Kings on Monday.

The Suns got out to a quick start in this one, grabbing a 25 - 18 lead right away after the first quarter. It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game, but the Suns were able to pull off a huge win, as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Suns were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 44 percent from the floor and a disgraceful eight percent from beyond the arc. The Suns were led by Markieff Morris, who finished with a team - high of 24 points (10 - 15 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), to go along with three rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. It was a very nice bounce - back outing for the forward, as he posted just four points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field during Monday's game against the Warriors. He's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year. Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe, who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and nine assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games. The Suns gained even more of an advantage from their bench in the win, as they were extremely productive. Rookie T.J. Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points (8 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) in just 19 minutes. The Suns drafted him knowing he could score at a high rate, so it's not surprising he was finally able to show a little more of what he's got. Marcus Thornton also reached double figures off the bench, with 14 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and four rebounds in 22 minutes. Kevin Martin did his best to keep the Timberwolves in this game. He went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 6 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 16 points. After shooting just 25 percent (2 - 8 FG) from the field in Monday's game against the Clippers, it was good to see him hit on such a high percentage of shots Wednesday. In a solid performance off the bench, Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points, while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves, as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season. With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season. In 29 minutes, he finished with 10 points (3 - 9 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds. Andrew Wiggins did n't have much of an impact either, as he also had just 10 points (5 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt) and four rebounds.

It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game, but the Suns were able to pull off a huge win, as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Suns were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 44 percent from the floor and a disgraceful eight percent from beyond the arc.

It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves, as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season. With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season. In 29 minutes, he finished with 10 points (3 - 9 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds.

Though Utah shot just 41 percent from the field, they ran away with the game by winning the turnover battle by a huge margin, surrendering the ball just seven times to the Sixers’ 18 giveaways. Rodney Hood and Alec Burks led the backcourt with 17 and 15 points, respectively, while Derrick Favors secured a double - double with 20 points and 12 boards to accompany three steals and two blocks. The 76ers compounded their turnover problems by shooting even worse than Utah from the field, submitting a 30 percent mark as a team. The chief offender was star center Nerlens Noel, who accrued just eight points while going 2 - for - 12 from the field. Philadelphia’s immense struggles earned a chorus of boos from the home crowd at multiple points in the game, a development unsurprising given the lack of progress the team has made since embarking on its massive rebuilding effort a couple years ago. Up next for Utah is a date with the Indiana Pacers in the second game of a road back - to - back set.

Brooklyn had not prevailed in consecutive games in nearly a calendar year, improbable as that sounds. Early on, it appeared the dubious streak would endure, as the Nets fell by a 32 - 22 margin after one quarter. However, they roared back in the second by outscoring Phoenix by a 30 - 18 margin and then took it up a couple of notches in the second half. The Nets outscored their visitors, 74 - 48, over the third and fourth quarters for one of their biggest victories of the season. A whopping eight players hit double digits in the scoring column, and Brooklyn played a stellar defensive game overall, limiting the Suns to a 37 percent success rate from the field and 29 percent figure from three - point range while also causing 19 turnovers. Phoenix was led by Devin Booker, who managed 28 points, two rebounds and three steals. Marquese Chriss continued his recent stretch of excellent play with 23 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and one block. Alex Len followed with an 11 - point, 11 - rebound double - double that also included one assist, two steals and two blocks. Tyler Ulis chipped in with a 10 - point, 12 - assist double - double that also featured a pair of steals. Leandro Barbosa paced the second unit with 11 points, six boards, one assist and one steal. Brook Lopez led the way for the Nets with 19 points, six rebounds and one block. K.J. McDaniels followed with a bench - leading 16 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Trevor Booker managed 14 points, eight boards and one assist. Jeremy Lin tallied 13 points, five assists and three rebounds. Archie Goodwin and Quincy Acy contributed matching 12 - point efforts as reserves. Isaiah Whitehead compiled 11 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block over 28 minutes. Justin Hamilton supplied 10 points and one rebound. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson mustered a modest five points but hauled in 16 boards, dished out two assists, recorded two steals and posted one block. The Suns next head to Boston to take on the Celtics on Friday night, while the Nets head to Washington to take on the Wizards on Friday evening as well.

Both of those patterns held true Saturday, as Houston compiled a whopping 77 points in the first half on their way to a blowout home win. James Harden led all scorers with 40 points, which he supplemented with eight assists and six rebounds. With Eric Bledsoe sitting out for rest, Phoenix could n't come close to keeping pace, and shot just 39 percent overall, which largely negated the 21 turnovers they elicited from the Rockets. Devin Booker led the way for the visitors with 18 points, two assists, one rebound and one steal. T.J. Warren followed with 14 points, five boards and three steals. Alex Len drew the start and managed 13 points, eight rebounds, two assists and one block. The second unit featured a trio of double - digit scoring efforts led by Tyler Ulis, who posted 13 points, six assists, two rebounds and one steal. Jared Dudley and Leandro Barbosa followed with matching 12 - point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block, and the latter hauling in three boards. Marquese Chriss chipped in with seven points, six rebounds and three assists. Patrick Beverley was a distant second behind Harden with 19 points, 10 boards, five assists and two steals. Ryan Anderson generated 16 points, four rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block. Sam Dekker was next with a bench - leading 14 points that he supplemented with four rebounds, one assist and one block. Trevor Ariza and Clint Capela provided a pair of nine - point tallies, with the former also collecting nine rebounds, two assists and three steals, and the latter hauling in five boards, dishing out a pair of dimes and recording a block. The Suns head back home to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday evening, while the Rockets welcome the Miami Heat on Wednesday night.
