While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons.

He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings.

It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals.

Kevin Love was the only other Cavalier to score in double figures, as he posted a double - double of 13 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland had won four in a row and seven of their last eight before Tuesday night, however, and still sit comfortable as the top team in the Eastern Conference. Up next, the Bucks will head to Brooklyn on Thursday to take on the Nets, while the Cavaliers will go home Thursday and play the Clippers.

42,5,Kevin Love,"The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 118 - 101 Tuesday at BMO Harris Bradley Center. The Bucks (8 - 8) took advantage of a Cavaliers (13 - 3) team that looked disinterested from the second quarter on, as Milwaukee managed to open up a four - point lead at halftime and won the game with the help of a dominant third quarter, which they won 34 - 20. It got so out of hand in the third period that Cleveland head coach Tyronn Lue pulled all five of his starters who were on the court. The Bucks were led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who continues to put together an All-Star-caliber season. The Greek Freak scored a game - high 34 points on top of 12 rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocked shots. Fellow young star Jabari Parker posted 18 points of his own, while Michael Beasley had one of his best performances of the season off the bench, scoring 17 points. As a team, the Bucks put together one of their best shooting nights of the year, as they shot an astounding 54 percent from the floor.

43,6,LeBron James,"The second - seed Cleveland Cavaliers (40) completed their sweep of the seventh - seed Boston Celtics (0 - 4) in a 101 - 93 slugfest Sunday. Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

77,10,Carmelo Anthony,"The New York Knicks (28 - 40) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (14 - 53) 90 - 87 on Sunday. The game was largely a tale of two halves, with New York dominating the first two quarters despite missing two starters on offense, and jumping out to a 46 - 35 lead by intermission. However, the Lakers battled back through the final two periods, and the two teams found themselves knotted at 87 with 29 seconds left. Neither club could find a way to break the tie over the ensuing 28 ticks of the clock, with Kobe Bryant failing to hit a 12 - foot jumper for the Lakers after a 19 - second possession. Carmelo Anthony hauled in the defensive rebound off the missed shot, and following a Knicks timeout, Jose Calderon sealed the victory with a clutch 26 - foot three - point jumper with less than a second remaining. Anthony led the way for the Knicks with a 26 - point, 12 - rebound double - double, to which he added four assists and a block. Robin Lopez contributed 16 points, eight boards, two assists and two blocks. Derrick Williams, getting a spot start in place of the sidelined Kristaps Porzingis (illness), filled out the stat sheet with eight points, nine rebounds, an assist, two steals and a block. Calderon finished with nine points, six assists, three rebounds and a steal. The Knicks remain in third place in the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division, and are seven games back of the eighth - seeded Detroit Pistons. They continue their West Coast swing with a trip to Golden State to face the Warriors on Wednesday night. Bryant spearheaded a pedestrian Lakers attack, tallying 14 points, two rebounds and a steal. Jordan Clarkson was the only other member of the starting five to manage double - digit scoring, recording 12 points, three rebounds, two assists and three steals. D'Angelo Russell notably turned in one of his worst efforts as a starter, posting only four points, two rebounds, two assists and a steal over 22 minutes. Lou Williams paced the reserves after a five - game absence, supplying 15 points, five assists, a rebound and a steal. The Lakers remain in last place in the Western Conference's Pacific Division.

99,12,Courtney Lee,"The Memphis Grizzlies (10) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (0 - 1) 105 - 101 Wednesday at the FedExForum in Memphis. It was n't the cleanest game ever played, with the Timberwolves handing out 23 turnovers and the Grizzlies racking up 17 of their own, but it was still a tight matchup that ended with a close finish. Marc Gasol put the Grizzlies on his back and helped the Grizzlies get their first victory of the year. Gasol finished the game with 32 points (12 - 17 FG), nine rebounds, three assists, two steals, and two blocked shots, getting a little bit of everything on the stat sheet Wednesday. Not far behind was Zach Randolph, who had 25 points (12 - 16 FG), 13 rebounds, an assist, and a block. Mike Conley also passed the double - digit benchmark and finished with 16 points to go along with one rebound, six assists, and a steal. The other starting guard, Courtney Lee, shot 5 - for - 11 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from behind the arc to score 14 points in 35 minutes of action. Despite the win, the Grizzlies got little output from their bench unit, who only scored 10 of their 105 total points. With a ton of fresh faces, this was finally a shot for Timberwolves' fans to see their new young lineup. Thaddeus Young was very efficient in his debut, scoring 26 points (10 - 18 FG, 2 - 3 3PT, 4 - 4 FT) and grabbing four rebounds, four assists, and two steals. Mo Williams matched Young's efficiency and added 18 points (6 - 9 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) of his own. Williams also contributed four assists and a steal. No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins made his regular season debut but only had six points, three rebounds, an assist, and two steals, playing just 18 minutes. The Grizzlies' next game is on the road Friday against the Indiana Pacers, while the Timberwolves will take on the Detroit Pistons on Thursday in Detroit.

The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own. Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game.

Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game. Bryant finished with 17 points, one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting, but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times, which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game. The Lakers will visit the Utah Jazz (36 - 37) on Monday, while the Wizards will head north to take on the Golden State Warriors (66 - 7).

114,14,Kobe Bryant,"The Washington Wizards (36 - 37) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (15 - 58) 101 - 88 at Staples Center on Sunday. Washington ended a short, but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road, and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards played at a high speed pace, led by John Wall, who diced through the Lakers defense and took advantage of his matchup with D’Angelo Russell. Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own.

115,15,Kendrick Perkins,"The Cleveland Cavaliers (53 - 29) defeated the Washington Wizards (46 - 36) 113 - 108 on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists.

The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists. This marks the final regular season game for both teams, but each will head into the playoffs which start this weekend.

With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest.

The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game. The one bright spot was the bench, as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together.

While Ferrell dropped jaws with his impressive play, wing Wesley Matthews also put together a stellar performance, scoring 27 points and coming away with six rebounds. As a whole, the team earned the win on the backs of strong three - point shooting. The Mavs shot an impressive 17 - of - 31 from beyond the arc. Portland (22 - 29), meanwhile, was let down by star point guard Damian Lillard. Lillard shot just 4 - of - 20 on the night in quite possibly his worst outing of the season. On the other hand, wing Evan Turner steped up for one of his best performances as a Blazer. Turner scored 24 points on 10 - of - 17 shooting. The Blazers held a rare advantage in the rebounding column, but were unable to shoot with nearly the efficiency of Dallas, ultimately ending in the loss. The Blazers will visit OKC on Sunday, while the Mavericks will visit Denver on Monday.

Dallas drained 11 three - pointers to Memphis’ seven, and the Mavs also outrebounded the home team 48 to 42. Zaza Pachulia’s performance particularly stood out in this regard, as he held his own against one of the best all - around centers in the game in Marc Gasol. Pachulia went toe - to - toe on the glass with the Grizzlies’ big man, matching his 10 boards while also collecting 13 points. Veteran Dirk Nowitzki posted a double - double of his own, his second on the season. The veteran power forward totaled 14 points and 10 rebounds, while adding a block and a steal. Deron Williams (10 points) and Wesley Matthews (11 points) made respectable contributions, with the latter draining three three - pointers, giving him seven over the last two contests. Reserves J.J. Barea and Raymond Felton paced the Dallas bench with a pair of 16 - point outings. Felton was notably perfect on three - pointers, draining all four of his shots from beyond the arc. The Mavericks fell to 9 - 6 and currently reside in second place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division. They travel to San Antonio for a Wednesday tilt versus the Spurs. The Grizzlies received a remarkably balanced offensive performance from their starters, something they have significantly lacked in many games this season. Gasol collected 15 points and the aforementioned 10 boards, while point guard Mike Conley continued his recent stretch of resurgent play on offense. The veteran tallied 21 points, six assists, and four rebounds, for his fourth game of 20 points or more in the last five contests. Matt Barnes parlayed his rare starting opportunity into a solid tally of 14 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals over 38 minutes. Jeff Green acquitted himself well filling in at power forward for the ailing Zach Randolph (knee), pitching in 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of blocks in a tough matchup against Nowitzki.

209,26,Lavoy Allen,"The Washington Wizards (19 - 19) defeated the Indiana Pacers (22 - 18) 118 - 104 on Friday. The Wizards have already dealt with the loss of an integral component for an extended stretch this season, and that experience is serving them well in the wake of the latest injury to a key cog of their team. Marcin Gortat is dealing with a series of knee complications that includes an infection, and has missed the last three games as a result. In his stead, Nene Hilario has stepped up with three solid performances, but multiple players elevated their respective games on the glass Friday to help make up for the big man's absence. The Wizards managed an outstanding 54 rebounds, including 37 on the defensive end. Meanwhile, Washington also shot a solid 52 percent from the field, and an equally impressive 44 percent from three - point range, leading to a relatively comfortable victory. John Wall spearheaded the Wizards' attack once again, posting a game - high 28 points and also tallying seven rebounds, eight assists and a steal. No other starter tallied double - digit scoring, but Hilario did match his eight points with eight boards, and added two assists, a steal and a block. Garrett Temple made another start in place of Beal, and contributed five points, six rebounds and five assists. However, Beal significantly outplayed him off the bench, posting 22 points, five rebounds and an assist over 22 minutes. DeJuan Blair and Gary Neal pitched in with a pair of 12 - point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals, and the latter managing four boards and three assists. Ramon Sessions was the fourth reserve with a double - digit point total, stuffing the stat sheet over 23 minutes with 10 points, five assists, three rebounds and two steals. The Wizards improved to 19 - 19 and currently reside in fourth place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They head to Boston to face the Celtics on Saturday.

Kemba Walker was outstanding for Charlotte, amassing a career - high and franchise - record 52 points, while Utah's Gordon Hayward responded with 36 points of his own. While the spotlight largely and rightfully shone on that pair of remarkable efforts, Trey Burke also put together a notable performance while pacing the Jazz's bench, which included a 23 - foot three - point jumper with 13 seconds remaining in regulation that sent the game into its first extra period. Burke's key basket culiminated a 31 - 22 run by Utah in the fourth quarter to erase what had been a 73 - 64 deficit entering the period. After Rudy Gobert's dunk off a Hayward assist with seven seconds left in the first overtime tied things up at 108, Walker drained four free throws in the final minute of the sixth quarter to put a cap on what was a record - setting afternoon and send the Hornets to the locker room as weary victors. Hayward added nine assists, five rebounds, a pair of steals and a block to his team - high scoring total to pace the Jazz. Burke's memorable afternoon consisted of a season - high 25 points, along with three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Gobert put together a second straight impressive double - double, tallying 14 points, hauling in 14 boards, dishing out three assists, and recording a steal and two blocks. Trevor Booker also made a significant contribution off the bench with 12 points, eight rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. Utah fell to 18 - 23 and remains in second place in the Western Conference's Northwest Division. They head to New York to take on the Knicks on Wednesday. Walker almost added a triple - double to his spectacular afternoon, supplementing his eye - popping scoring numbers with nine rebounds and eight assists. He also threw in a pair of thefts. Marvin Williams was a distant second to him in scoring, but still turned in a solid effort with 19 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. Cody Zeller managed 14 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block, while Nicolas Batum was a rebound short of a double - double with 10 points, nine boards, four assists and a steal.

The 2015 Finals rematch featuring two of the very best in the NBA turned out to be more of a showcase for both teams' often underrated defenses. Neither squad was able to put on much of an offensive display, and the game had more of the feel of a grind - it - out Eastern Conference battle, rather than the free - wheeling, high - scoring affairs typically played by the reigning champs. The Warriors shot 41 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc, with both numbers notably lower than their respective 49 and 42 season figures in those categories. Cleveland fared even worse, draining only 32 percent of their buckets overall, including a paltry 17 percent from long range. Both teams' point totals were also season - low tallies, underscoring how formidable both defensive units can be against top - tier competition. The Cavs were led by Lebron James' game - high 25 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and a pair of blocks. Despite the solid scoring total, the perennial All-Star was one of the superstars struggling with his shot, sinking only 10 of his 26 attempts. J.R. Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Kevin Love helped spearhead Cleveland's outstanding team total of 55 rebounds on the evening by hauling in 18 boards, and pairing them with 10 points in his second straight double - double. Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting. However, the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds, seven assists and a pair of steals. The perpetually dependable Klay Thompson was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role, pitching in with 18 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Shaun Livingston was highly productive off the bench with a season - high 16 points, leading the Warriors' reserves. Golden State improved to 28 - 1 and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division, Western Conference and the entire NBA. They remain home for a date with the Sacramento Kings on Monday.

The 2015 Finals rematch featuring two of the very best in the NBA turned out to be more of a showcase for both teams' often underrated defenses. Neither squad was able to put on much of an offensive display, and the game had more of the feel of a grind - it - out Eastern Conference battle, rather than the free - wheeling, high - scoring affairs typically played by the reigning champs. The Warriors shot 41 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc, with both numbers notably lower than their respective 49 and 42 season figures in those categories. Cleveland fared even worse, draining only 32 percent of their buckets overall, including a paltry 17 percent from long range. Both teams' point totals were also season - low tallies, underscoring how formidable both defensive units can be against top - tier competition. The Cavs were led by Lebron James' game - high 25 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and a pair of blocks. Despite the solid scoring total, the perennial All-Star was one of the superstars struggling with his shot, sinking only 10 of his 26 attempts. J.R. Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Kevin Love helped spearhead Cleveland's outstanding team total of 55 rebounds on the evening by hauling in 18 boards, and pairing them with 10 points in his second straight double - double. Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting.

Cousins, Collison, and forward Rudy Gay each added three three - pointers, contributing to the 12 made by the team on the night. Sacramento reached a .500 record at home with the win. For the Thunder (8 - 8), things are continuing to get worse after the team started a surprising 5 - 1 to open the season. Point guard Russell Westbrook, however, has not seemed to slow down. The NBA's leading scorer scored another 31 points on Wednesday, to go along with 11 rebounds and nine assists. Westbrook's numbers thus far have indicated that he may have a chance at being the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple - double in a season. The Thunder continued to struggle from deep in Tuesday's contest, shooting just 28 percent from beyond the arc. The team hit just seven triples in the contest. The thunder will travel to Denver on Friday, while the Kings will host the Houston Rockets.

The Suns got out to a quick start in this one, grabbing a 25 - 18 lead right away after the first quarter. It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game, but the Suns were able to pull off a huge win, as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Suns were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 44 percent from the floor and a disgraceful eight percent from beyond the arc. The Suns were led by Markieff Morris, who finished with a team - high of 24 points (10 - 15 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), to go along with three rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. It was a very nice bounce - back outing for the forward, as he posted just four points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field during Monday's game against the Warriors. He's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year. Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe, who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and nine assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games. The Suns gained even more of an advantage from their bench in the win, as they were extremely productive. Rookie T.J. Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points (8 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) in just 19 minutes.

In a solid performance off the bench, Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points, while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves, as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season. With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season. In 29 minutes, he finished with 10 points (3 - 9 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds.

The chief offender was star center Nerlens Noel, who accrued just eight points while going 2 - for - 12 from the field. Philadelphia’s immense struggles earned a chorus of boos from the home crowd at multiple points in the game, a development unsurprising given the lack of progress the team has made since embarking on its massive rebuilding effort a couple years ago.

The 76ers compounded their turnover problems by shooting even worse than Utah from the field, submitting a 30 percent mark as a team. The chief offender was star center Nerlens Noel, who accrued just eight points while going 2 - for - 12 from the field. Philadelphia’s immense struggles earned a chorus of boos from the home crowd at multiple points in the game, a development unsurprising given the lack of progress the team has made since embarking on its massive rebuilding effort a couple years ago. Up next for Utah is a date with the Indiana Pacers in the second game of a road back - to - back set.

A whopping eight players hit double digits in the scoring column, and Brooklyn played a stellar defensive game overall, limiting the Suns to a 37 percent success rate from the field and 29 percent figure from three - point range while also causing 19 turnovers. Phoenix was led by Devin Booker, who managed 28 points, two rebounds and three steals.

Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double - double, finishing with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He has n't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 7 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate.

Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that.

The Nuggets shot much better than the Pelicans in this game, going 46 percent from the field and an impressive 59 percent from the three - point line, while the Pelicans shot 39 percent from the floor and just 20 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans out - rebounded the Nuggets 48 - 39, but it was n't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance, as they dropped a tough loss at home. Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 20 points. It was his second solid game in a row, combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span. Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double - double, finishing with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He has n't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 7 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate. Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11 - 22 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25 - point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds.
