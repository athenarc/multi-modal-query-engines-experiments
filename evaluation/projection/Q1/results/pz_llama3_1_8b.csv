When it was all said and done, the pair of guards who struggled throughout five periods bested the two with the hot hand. In an overtime thriller in London, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they'd left their shots back across the Atlantic, going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field. Meanwhile, the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire, particularly in the second half, to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts. However, despite a game - high 27 points, Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most, missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory. He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105, essentially sealing Orlando's fate. Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance, as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe. He also hauled in eight rebounds, dished out seven assists, and tallied a block and a steal. DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points, but was outstanding on the boards, posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season. Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan's scoring total and added nine boards, two assists, a steal and three blocks, two of which were key stuffs of Nikola Vucevic in the fourth quarter and overtime, respectively. Luis Scola put together a solid contribution of 11 points, two rebounds and three steals, while three Raptors reserves were highly efficient. Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points, four assists, three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes, while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings.

The Raptors improved to 25 - 15 and remain atop the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division. They head back home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Monday. Oladipo's 27 points were supplemented by six rebounds, six assists and a pair of steals. Fournier was right on his heels with 21 points, three assists, three rebounds and a steal.

Tobias Harris nearly matched him point - for - point and board - for - board, tallying 16 on the scoreboard and hauling in 11 off the glass. He also dished out three assists and recorded a steal. Jason Smith was outstanding off the bench in the first half for Orlando with 16 points, but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period.

In an overtime thriller in London, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they'd left their shots back across the Atlantic, going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field. Meanwhile, the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire, particularly in the second half, to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts.

He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105, essentially sealing Orlando's fate. Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance, as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe. He also hauled in eight rebounds, dished out seven assists, and tallied a block and a steal. DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points, but was outstanding on the boards, posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season.

With the game comfortably in hand, the second seed in the East was able to limit their players' court time, with John Wall leading the team with only 28 minutes played. The 12 assists Wall distributed made it three consecutive games with double - digit helpers. Nene returned to action, after sitting out the previous five games with plantar fasciitis, but was n't immediately inserted into the starting lineup. He scored eight points with eight rebounds in 18 minutes off the bench. Kris Humphries, who started in place of Nene, led the Wizards with 20 points, which came on the back of his 20 - rebound performance Wednesday. Washington was scorching from the field, hitting 53 percent of their field goal attempts, compared with the Nuggets, who could manage just 38 percent conversion. The Wizards travel to Boston to take on the struggling Celtics on Sunday. While John Wall is beginning a nice little streak of double - digit assist games, he's got a while to go before he catches Ty Lawson, who extended his run to seven games with double - digit assists. Lawson added 14 points and three steals to his 10 assists. Wilson Chandler was the only other member of the Nuggets to score in double - digits, dropping 20 points in 25 minutes.

"report_56.txt","The Toronto Raptors (25 - 15) defeated the Orlando Magic (20 - 19) 106 - 103 in overtime on Thursday afternoon in London. When it was all said and done, the pair of guards who struggled throughout five periods bested the two with the hot hand. In an overtime thriller in London, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they'd left their shots back across the Atlantic, going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field. Meanwhile, the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire, particularly in the second half, to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts. However, despite a game - high 27 points, Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most, missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory. He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105, essentially sealing Orlando's fate. Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance, as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe. He also hauled in eight rebounds, dished out seven assists, and tallied a block and a steal. DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points, but was outstanding on the boards, posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season. Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan's scoring total and added nine boards, two assists, a steal and three blocks, two of which were key stuffs of Nikola Vucevic in the fourth quarter and overtime, respectively. Luis Scola put together a solid contribution of 11 points, two rebounds and three steals, while three Raptors reserves were highly efficient. Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points, four assists, three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes, while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings. The latter's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers, which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon. The Raptors improved to 25 - 15 and remain atop the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division. They head back home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Monday. Oladipo's 27 points were supplemented by six rebounds, six assists and a pair of steals. Fournier was right on his heels with 21 points, three assists, three rebounds and a steal. Nikola Vucevic posted a 17 - point, 11 - rebound double - double, which he complemented with four assists and three blocks. Tobias Harris nearly matched him point - for - point and board - for - board, tallying 16 on the scoreboard and hauling in 11 off the glass. He also dished out three assists and recorded a steal. Jason Smith was outstanding off the bench in the first half for Orlando with 16 points, but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period. He did add five rebounds, four assists and a block. The Magic fell to 20 - 19 and remain in third place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division.

Whiteside also hauled in 14 rebounds, dished out one assist, and recorded five blocks, while Waiters added nine rebounds and seven assists. Goran Dragic was right behind his teammates with 21 points, five assists and one rebound. Rodney McGruder supplied 11 points, two assists, one rebound and two steals.

It remained tight throughout the fourth quarter, as neither team managed more than a five - point lead at any point in the period, but Detroit's one - two punch of Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson proved to be too tough for the Nets. Drummond finished with his third double - double in his past four games as he scored a team - high 21 points and grabbed a game - high 18 rebounds, including seven on the offensive end. Jacksom scored 19 and dished out six assists, and Ersan Ilyasova and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 16 apiece.

Atlanta shot just 41 percent from the floor, but they were active both on the offensive glass (13 offensive rebounds) and in the passing lanes (16 steals), and that allowed them to nab the win despite lacking their shooting touch. Devin Booker made the Suns offense go, as he scored a game - high 34 points on a ludicrously efficient 12 - 25 shooting night, including 4 - 9 from deep. Booker added five rebounds, two assists and two steals and turned the ball over just twice despite using over 30 possessions. He got little help, though, as Ronnie Price was Phoenix's second leading scorer with 14 points (4 - 9 FG, 4 - 7 3PT). Price committed seven turnovers, however, and the Suns were sloppy all night, as Phoenix committed 24 turnovers and managed just 19 assists.

Isiah Thomas and company physically battled their way through the first quarter, but still came out six points down, and the Clippers simply built on their lead during the rest of the game. Thomas chased down Chris Paul in transition for a highlight block, but it did not get any prettier than that for his team. The Clippers bench proved to be the difference in the game, as the starters failed to provide much offense. Jamal Crawford, Jeff Green, Wesley Johnson and Austin Rivers all finished in double figures, while Chris Paul dished out 14 assists and DeAndre Jordan commanded the paint and added 13 rebounds. Shot selection was key for the bench roles, as Los Angeles drained 52 percent of their shots and dished out 29 assists. Paul’s assist total matched that of the entire Celtics team. Isiah Thomas found success attacking the rim and did most of his damage from the free throw line. The all - star point guard finished with 24 points to lead all scorers (5 - of - 14 FG, 12 - of - 13 FT) and two assists.

Phoenix exploded to a 10 - point lead with a 38 - point first quarter and entered halftime with a 12 - point lead. But the Suns offense could n't maintain the pace, as they could n't reach 20 points in any of the final three quarters. The Hawks chipped away throughout the second half. Atlanta opened the fourth quarter on a 12 - 2 run to turn a 73 - 70 deficit into an 82 - 75 lead, and they would n't give it up. Jeff Teague's 20 points led the Hawks as he knocked down three of his seven three - point attempts. The Hawks got double - doubles from Paul Millsap (13 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists) and Al Horford (16 points, 10 rebounds). Kent Bazemore nearly added a third, as he poured in 17 points (7 - 13 FG, 2 - 5 3PT), grabbed nine rebounds, dished five assists and swiped five steals. Atlanta shot just 41 percent from the floor, but they were active both on the offensive glass (13 offensive rebounds) and in the passing lanes (16 steals), and that allowed them to nab the win despite lacking their shooting touch. Devin Booker made the Suns offense go, as he scored a game - high 34 points on a ludicrously efficient 12 - 25 shooting night, including 4 - 9 from deep. Booker added five rebounds, two assists and two steals and turned the ball over just twice despite using over 30 possessions. He got little help, though, as Ronnie Price was Phoenix's second leading scorer with 14 points (4 - 9 FG, 4 - 7 3PT). Price committed seven turnovers, however, and the Suns were sloppy all night, as Phoenix committed 24 turnovers and managed just 19 assists. The Hawks continue their homestand Thursday against the Raptors. The Suns continue their road trip Thursday against the Rockets.

But the Suns offense could n't maintain the pace, as they could n't reach 20 points in any of the final three quarters. The Hawks chipped away throughout the second half. Atlanta opened the fourth quarter on a 12 - 2 run to turn a 73 - 70 deficit into an 82 - 75 lead, and they would n't give it up. Jeff Teague's 20 points led the Hawks as he knocked down three of his seven three - point attempts. The Hawks got double - doubles from Paul Millsap (13 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists) and Al Horford (16 points, 10 rebounds). Kent Bazemore nearly added a third, as he poured in 17 points (7 - 13 FG, 2 - 5 3PT), grabbed nine rebounds, dished five assists and swiped five steals. Atlanta shot just 41 percent from the floor, but they were active both on the offensive glass (13 offensive rebounds) and in the passing lanes (16 steals), and that allowed them to nab the win despite lacking their shooting touch. Devin Booker made the Suns offense go, as he scored a game - high 34 points on a ludicrously efficient 12 - 25 shooting night, including 4 - 9 from deep. Booker added five rebounds, two assists and two steals and turned the ball over just twice despite using over 30 possessions. He got little help, though, as Ronnie Price was Phoenix's second leading scorer with 14 points (4 - 9 FG, 4 - 7 3PT). Price committed seven turnovers, however, and the Suns were sloppy all night, as Phoenix committed 24 turnovers and managed just 19 assists.

He just recorded 18 points and six assists in Sunday's game against the Spurs, so LaVine has been making his case for extended playing time. Kevin Martin had a strong showing as well though, posting 20 points (7 - 16 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and six assists in 32 minutes. He's been shooting the ball well of late, especially from the three - point line, as he's combined to go 5 - for - 8 from beyond the arc over his last two games. The Timberwolves saw some impressive contributions from the bench as well. Chase Budinger had his shot locked in and scored 18 points (8 - 10 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt) in just 26 minutes, while Justin Hamilton posted 15 points (6 - 14 FG, 3 - 3 FT) and six rebounds as well. Despite a season scoring average of 4 points on the year, he 'picked his game up recently and is averaging 14 points over his last four games, while playing extra minutes with so many injuries. The Nets' frontcourt did the bulk of the work for Brooklyn in the win, combining for 57 points. Joe Johnson led the way, as he went 10 - for - 14 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 22 points to go along with five rebounds in just 25 minutes. He's been hitting nearly everything lately, combining to go 16 - for - 24 from the field over his last two games. Thaddeus Young also had a strong showing, finishing with 19 points (8 - 17 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and three rebounds. Since joining the Nets 13 games ago, he's averaging 14 points, 5 rebounds, 1 assists and 2 steals while starting five of those games. Brook Lopez was the third member of the starting lineup in double figures, as he recorded 16 points on 7 - of - 8 shooting from the floor. Coming up big on the bench was both Jarrett Jack and Bojan Bogdanovic. Jack chipped in with 16 points (6 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and five assists, while Bogdanovic added 21 points (10 - 15 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt) and four rebounds. The Nets' next game will be on the road against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Toronto to play the Raptors on Wednesday.

Phoenix exploded to a 10 - point lead with a 38 - point first quarter and entered halftime with a 12 - point lead. But the Suns offense could n't maintain the pace, as they could n't reach 20 points in any of the final three quarters. The Hawks chipped away throughout the second half. Atlanta opened the fourth quarter on a 12 - 2 run to turn a 73 - 70 deficit into an 82 - 75 lead, and they would n't give it up. Jeff Teague's 20 points led the Hawks as he knocked down three of his seven three - point attempts. The Hawks got double - doubles from Paul Millsap (13 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists) and Al Horford (16 points, 10 rebounds). Kent Bazemore nearly added a third, as he poured in 17 points (7 - 13 FG, 2 - 5 3PT), grabbed nine rebounds, dished five assists and swiped five steals. Atlanta shot just 41 percent from the floor, but they were active both on the offensive glass (13 offensive rebounds) and in the passing lanes (16 steals), and that allowed them to nab the win despite lacking their shooting touch. Devin Booker made the Suns offense go, as he scored a game - high 34 points on a ludicrously efficient 12 - 25 shooting night, including 4 - 9 from deep. Booker added five rebounds, two assists and two steals and turned the ball over just twice despite using over 30 possessions. He got little help, though, as Ronnie Price was Phoenix's second leading scorer with 14 points (4 - 9 FG, 4 - 7 3PT). Price committed seven turnovers, however, and the Suns were sloppy all night, as Phoenix committed 24 turnovers and managed just 19 assists.

Thomas chased down Chris Paul in transition for a highlight block, but it did not get any prettier than that for his team. The Clippers bench proved to be the difference in the game, as the starters failed to provide much offense. Jamal Crawford, Jeff Green, Wesley Johnson and Austin Rivers all finished in double figures, while Chris Paul dished out 14 assists and DeAndre Jordan commanded the paint and added 13 rebounds. Shot selection was key for the bench roles, as Los Angeles drained 52 percent of their shots and dished out 29 assists. Paul’s assist total matched that of the entire Celtics team. Isiah Thomas found success attacking the rim and did most of his damage from the free throw line. The all - star point guard finished with 24 points to lead all scorers (5 - of - 14 FG, 12 - of - 13 FT) and two assists. Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart were the only other Celtics to join Thomas in double figures, which was unsurprising given the defensive effort and size they were matched up against.

The Mavericks (30 - 39) came into Sunday's contest in urgent need of a win, not only to keep pace behind the eighth - seeded Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference, but to also put the considerable bad taste of a 116 - 74 loss to the Sixers on Friday behind them. A matchup against the defensively - challenged Brooklyn Nets proved to be what the doctor ordered, as Dallas shot 54 percent from the field and used a 57 - 43 halftime lead as the foundation for the road victory. Dirk Nowitzki and J.J. Barea's 20 - point efforts from the starting five and bench, respectively, led the way, and modest but balanced efforts across the rest of the rotation helped the Mavs hold off the feisty Nets (13 - 56). Nowitzki contributed a near double - double of 23 points and nine rebounds. Barea was next with 20 points, seven assists, one rebound and two steals. Harrison Barnes tallied 19 points, six rebounds and two assists. Wesley Matthews supplied 15 points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal. Yogi Ferrell registered eight points, five assists, two rebounds, three steals and a block. Devin Harris was productive as a reserve as well with 11 points, two boards, one assist and one steal.

The Pistons took a 10 - point lead in the third quarter and looked poised to run away with it, but the Nets bench led by Andrea Bargnani put the Nets back on top early in the fourth quarter. It remained tight throughout the fourth quarter, as neither team managed more than a five - point lead at any point in the period, but Detroit's one - two punch of Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson proved to be too tough for the Nets. Drummond finished with his third double - double in his past four games as he scored a team - high 21 points and grabbed a game - high 18 rebounds, including seven on the offensive end. Jacksom scored 19 and dished out six assists, and Ersan Ilyasova and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 16 apiece. The Pistons shot poorly (43 percent) but used a ridiculous 19 offensive rebounds to keep their offense from going stagnant. Brook Lopez was ultra - efficient, as he scored a game - high 27 points on 13 - 19 shooting and grabbed five rebounds. Bargnani scored 18 off the bench on 7 - 12 shooting, but Wayne Ellington (4 - 11 FG, 3 - 5 3PT) was the only other Nets player to reach double - digits with 11. The Nets shot 49 percent from the floor, well above the Pistons' mark, but thanks to their work on the glass, Detroit took 16 more field goals (98) than Brooklyn (82), and that proved to be the difference in the game. The Pistons will continue their east coast road trip Wednesday in Boston. The Nets will continue their homestand with a Wednesday game against the Pacers.

Wade's mark was the highest of any Bull, as the team hit 11 shots from three - point range in total. One of those shots came from another new face, point guard Rajon Rondo. Rondo is another player who many speculated would cause trouble for Chicago's floor spacing, but he got the job done along with his new backcourt partner. It was a good night for All-Star players, as Wade was n't the only star to score over 20. Jimmy Butler led the Bulls with 24, while Boston point guard Isaiah Thomas scored 25.

"report_48.txt","The Denver Nuggets (19 - 27) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (24 - 22) 93 - 85 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. The Nuggets shot much better than the Pelicans in this game, going 46 percent from the field and an impressive 59 percent from the three - point line, while the Pelicans shot 39 percent from the floor and just 20 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans out - rebounded the Nuggets 48 - 39, but it was n't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance, as they dropped a tough loss at home. Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 20 points. It was his second solid game in a row, combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span. Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double - double, finishing with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He has n't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 7 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate. Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11 - 22 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25 - point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds. The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday, while the Pelicans will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday.

In an overtime thriller in London, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they'd left their shots back across the Atlantic, going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field. Meanwhile, the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire, particularly in the second half, to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts.

He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105, essentially sealing Orlando's fate. Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance, as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe.

The latter's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers, which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon.

The 2015 Finals rematch featuring two of the very best in the NBA turned out to be more of a showcase for both teams' often underrated defenses. Neither squad was able to put on much of an offensive display, and the game had more of the feel of a grind - it - out Eastern Conference battle, rather than the free - wheeling, high - scoring affairs typically played by the reigning champs. The Warriors shot 41 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc, with both numbers notably lower than their respective 49 and 42 season figures in those categories. Cleveland fared even worse, draining only 32 percent of their buckets overall, including a paltry 17 percent from long range. Both teams' point totals were also season - low tallies, underscoring how formidable both defensive units can be against top - tier competition. The Cavs were led by Lebron James' game - high 25 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and a pair of blocks. Despite the solid scoring total, the perennial All-Star was one of the superstars struggling with his shot, sinking only 10 of his 26 attempts. J.R. Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Kevin Love helped spearhead Cleveland's outstanding team total of 55 rebounds on the evening by hauling in 18 boards, and pairing them with 10 points in his second straight double - double. Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting. However, the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds, seven assists and a pair of steals. The perpetually dependable Klay Thompson was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role, pitching in with 18 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Shaun Livingston was highly productive off the bench with a season - high 16 points, leading the Warriors' reserves. Golden State improved to 28 - 1 and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division, Western Conference and the entire NBA. They remain home for a date with the Sacramento Kings on Monday.

Both the Clippers and Celtics control the 4 - seed in their respective conferences, but Los Angeles proved once again that the elite teams in the Western Conference are more overpowering than the elite teams in the Eastern Conference. Isiah Thomas and company physically battled their way through the first quarter, but still came out six points down, and the Clippers simply built on their lead during the rest of the game. Thomas chased down Chris Paul in transition for a highlight block, but it did not get any prettier than that for his team. The Clippers bench proved to be the difference in the game, as the starters failed to provide much offense. Jamal Crawford, Jeff Green, Wesley Johnson and Austin Rivers all finished in double figures, while Chris Paul dished out 14 assists and DeAndre Jordan commanded the paint and added 13 rebounds. Shot selection was key for the bench roles, as Los Angeles drained 52 percent of their shots and dished out 29 assists. Paul’s assist total matched that of the entire Celtics team. Isiah Thomas found success attacking the rim and did most of his damage from the free throw line. The all - star point guard finished with 24 points to lead all scorers (5 - of - 14 FG, 12 - of - 13 FT) and two assists. Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart were the only other Celtics to join Thomas in double figures, which was unsurprising given the defensive effort and size they were matched up against.

Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation.

Wall is accustomed to dealing dimes against Sacramento, his season high 19 assists came against the Kings late in December. From there on out Cousins went on to score at will and abuse his matchup with Marcin Gortat. Washington got some life back in them when Otto Porter Jr. went on a scoring run in the third quarter, but poor shot selection in the final period sank their chances of overcoming the deficit. Cousins finished with 29 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and four blocks on 11 - of - 18 shooting in 32 minutes. Rondo completed his 36th double - double of the season with 15 points and 11 assists. The Kings elite duo looked fresh after sitting out against the Trail Blazers on Monday. Rudy Gay either knocked down his midrange jumpers, but failed to convert a three - pointer, as he finished 0 - of - 3 from behind the arc. Gay finished with 15 points and four boards. The Sacramento bench saw three standout double figure performances from Omri Casspi, Kosta Koufos and Darren Collison, with the latter of the trio impressively completing a double - double alongside Rondo with 13 points and 10 assists. Bradley Beal and Porter Jr. aided the Wizards in the scoring department, as John Wall’s jump shot failed him for a second consecutive game. Beal added 24 points, three rebounds and four assists, while also providing a highlight of his handles after taking advantage of the flat footed Willie Cauley-Stein for a pretty crossover. Most of Porter Jr’s 20 points came in the third quarter, but his shooting was efficient after going 8 - of - 11 from the field. The Wizards out - rebounded and out - assisted the Kings, but even after shooting 48 percent from the field, it was not enough to match the Kings lights out 56 percent shooting as a unit. Both teams will suit up on Friday, as the Kings will host the MIami Heat (43 - 30), while the Wizards visit the Phoenix Suns (20 - 55).

DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay once again carried the load for the visitors, as they have been the Kings' top two scorers in every game they've both played this season. This was actually the first game that at least two other starters scored in double figures for the Kings for the entirety of the season. The Raptors stars really struggled shooting, as Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan combined to go 12 - of - 36 in the loss.

Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay once again carried the load for the visitors, as they have been the Kings' top two scorers in every game they've both played this season. This was actually the first game that at least two other starters scored in double figures for the Kings for the entirety of the season. The Raptors stars really struggled shooting, as Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan combined to go 12 - of - 36 in the loss. The 23 - point outing from DeMar DeRozan was his lowest of the season, as he hadn’t scored below 32 points all year. With Jonas Valanciunas out of the lineup with a knee contusion, Toronto really struggled down low. In fact, they had no big man reach double figures in scoring or rebounding, while being outscored in the paint 52 - 30.

Kemba Walker was outstanding for Charlotte, amassing a career - high and franchise - record 52 points, while Utah's Gordon Hayward responded with 36 points of his own.

After Rudy Gobert's dunk off a Hayward assist with seven seconds left in the first overtime tied things up at 108, Walker drained four free throws in the final minute of the sixth quarter to put a cap on what was a record - setting afternoon and send the Hornets to the locker room as weary victors. Hayward added nine assists, five rebounds, a pair of steals and a block to his team - high scoring total to pace the Jazz. Burke's memorable afternoon consisted of a season - high 25 points, along with three rebounds, two assists and a steal.

The Bucks also out - rebounded the Knicks 48 - 36, giving them in an even further advantage which helped them secure the 13 - point victory on the road. Brandon Knight led the Bucks again in this one. He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 17 points, while also handing out five assists. He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double - double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster were n't able to limit him. Notching a double - double of his own, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded 16 points (6 - 9 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT) and 12 rebounds. The 12 rebounds matched a season - high, while it was his second double - double of the season. Coming off the bench for a big night was Kendall Marshall. He went 6 - for - 8 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 15 points in 20 minutes. The Knicks really struggled to score without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Tim Hardaway Jr led the team as the starting shooting guard, going 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also adding four assists. He's now scored 17 or more points in three out of his last four games, as he has put it on himself to pick up the slack with other key players sitting out. J.R. Smith also put together a solid outing as a starter. He finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 37 minutes. Like Haradaway Jr, he's also benefitted from other guys sitting out, and has now combined for 37 points over his last two games. While he did n't have his best night defensively, Cole Aldrich scored 12 points (6 - 10 FG) and grabbed seven rebounds in 19 minutes. The only other Knick to reach double figures in points was Jason Smith, who came off the bench for 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 4 - 4 FT). The Bucks' next game will be at home against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday, while the Knicks will travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Monday.

The Pelicans will stay in Los Angeles to play the Los Angeles Lakers on the second game of their back - to - back set.

Down 97 - 96 with just under 10 seconds left in the game, Pau Gasol was able to to throw down a dunk to put the Bulls up one. The Magic went to Nikola Vucevic for the game winner, but he was n't able to convert, giving the Bulls the narrow victory on the road in Orlando. While the Magic were able to out - rebound the Bulls 45 - 35, they were forced into 18 turnovers, which may have been just enough to push the Bulls to win number 32 on the season and keep them a half game ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division. The Bulls saw huge games from both Jimmy Butler and Gasol. Butler was all over the place, recording a team - high of 27 points (9 - 16 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), to go along with five assists and an impressive six steals. He's played extremely well of late, averaging 24 points, 4 steals and 4 assists over his last three games. The six steals also matched a season - high. Gasol, on the other hand, posted 25 points (10 - 16 FG, 5 - 6 FT) and 15 rebounds in 37 minutes. It was his twelfth double - double in a row, pushing his season averages to 18 points and 12 rebounds per game. While slightly over - shadowed by the performances of Butler and Gasol, Joakim Noah had a large impact on this game. He finished with 18 points (7 - 10 FG, 4 - 4 FT), nine rebounds and two steals. It matched a season - high in points for him as well and was great for his confidence offensively, as he had combinded for only three points over his last two games. Derrick Rose notched a double - double with 10 points (4 - 14 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and 11 assists. The Magic saw six players reach double figures in points, including all five of their starters, but still were n't able to hold off the Bulls. Victor Oladipo finished with a team - high of 18 points (8 - 16 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), while also adding six assists and two steals. He continues to make a nice contribution defensively, as it was his third straight game recording two steals. He's now averaging 17 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists on the year. Tobias Harris nearly recorded a double - double, posting 15 points (6 - 17 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), eight rebounds and three steals. He's had a nice three - game stretch where he's averaged 24 points and 8 rebounds per game. The ever so consistent Nikola Vucevic had somewhat of a down game, totaling 14 points (5 - 14 FG, 4 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds in 32 minutes. It was his lowest scoring output since January ninth against the Lakers, so it came quite unexpected. Coming off the bench, Evan Fournier was very efficient with his time and posted 14 points (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), three rebounds and three assists in only 18 minutes. The Magic's next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Bulls will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday.

With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists. This marks the final regular season game for both teams, but each will head into the playoffs which start this weekend.

Sacramento lost three straight games coming into their matchup with the Spurs, and it was starting to appear as though their hot start to the season was simply a streak of good luck. However, with a win over the NBA champions, the Kings have shown that they're going to try and earnestly fight for a playoff spot this season. They missed all 12 of their three - point attempts in this game, but the inside work of DeMarcus Cousins, Rudy and Darren Collison was enough to carry the team.

The Bucks jumped out of the gate with a 37 - 28 first quarter, perhaps catching the Warriors lagging on the second night of a back - to - back. However, the Warriors answered right back with a 41 - 29 second quarter to take a 69 - 66 lead into halftime. After trailing by 14 with 6:56 left in the fourth, the Bucks battled back to make it a two - point game with two minutes to go but could not capitalize on multiple opportunities to tie or take the lead. Milwaukee (5 - 7) had a great night offensively, shooting 52 percent from the field and 10 - of - 20 from long range, while also filling it up with 52 points in the paint. The Bucks tallied 27 assists, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who finished with six assists, along with a team - high 30 points, four rebounds, two steals and one block, in 41 minutes. Jabari Parker was the second half of Milwaukee's one - two punch, as he finished with 28 points, along with five assists, five rebounds and two steals, in 37 minutes. This was the third loss in a row for the Bucks, who go on to host the Orlando Magic on Monday. The Warriors (11 - 2) notched their second win in as many nights and seventh straight as they scored their way to victory in Milwaukee. The Warriors have found their groove and are scoring like many expected they would, averaging 123 points per game in their last five contests. Kevin Durant led the way in this one with 33 points on 10 - of - 17 shooting, along with six rebounds, five assists and two steals in 36 minutes. Klay Thompson was efficient as well with 29 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting, while Stephen Curry added 20 points.

Rodney Hood and Alec Burks led the backcourt with 17 and 15 points, respectively, while Derrick Favors secured a double - double with 20 points and 12 boards to accompany three steals and two blocks. The 76ers compounded their turnover problems by shooting even worse than Utah from the field, submitting a 30 percent mark as a team. The chief offender was star center Nerlens Noel, who accrued just eight points while going 2 - for - 12 from the field. Philadelphia’s immense struggles earned a chorus of boos from the home crowd at multiple points in the game, a development unsurprising given the lack of progress the team has made since embarking on its massive rebuilding effort a couple years ago. Up next for Utah is a date with the Indiana Pacers in the second game of a road back - to - back set.

Rodney Hood and Alec Burks led the backcourt with 17 and 15 points, respectively, while Derrick Favors secured a double - double with 20 points and 12 boards to accompany three steals and two blocks. The 76ers compounded their turnover problems by shooting even worse than Utah from the field, submitting a 30 percent mark as a team. The chief offender was star center Nerlens Noel, who accrued just eight points while going 2 - for - 12 from the field. Philadelphia’s immense struggles earned a chorus of boos from the home crowd at multiple points in the game, a development unsurprising given the lack of progress the team has made since embarking on its massive rebuilding effort a couple years ago. Up next for Utah is a date with the Indiana Pacers in the second game of a road back - to - back set.

Washington ended a short, but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road, and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards played at a high speed pace, led by John Wall, who diced through the Lakers defense and took advantage of his matchup with D’Angelo Russell. Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout.

Marcin Gortat is dealing with a series of knee complications that includes an infection, and has missed the last three games as a result.

No other starter tallied double - digit scoring, but Hilario did match his eight points with eight boards, and added two assists, a steal and a block. Garrett Temple made another start in place of Beal, and contributed five points, six rebounds and five assists. However, Beal significantly outplayed him off the bench, posting 22 points, five rebounds and an assist over 22 minutes. DeJuan Blair and Gary Neal pitched in with a pair of 12 - point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals, and the latter managing four boards and three assists.

Brooklyn had not prevailed in consecutive games in nearly a calendar year, improbable as that sounds. Early on, it appeared the dubious streak would endure, as the Nets fell by a 32 - 22 margin after one quarter. However, they roared back in the second by outscoring Phoenix by a 30 - 18 margin and then took it up a couple of notches in the second half. The Nets outscored their visitors, 74 - 48, over the third and fourth quarters for one of their biggest victories of the season. A whopping eight players hit double digits in the scoring column, and Brooklyn played a stellar defensive game overall, limiting the Suns to a 37 percent success rate from the field and 29 percent figure from three - point range while also causing 19 turnovers. Phoenix was led by Devin Booker, who managed 28 points, two rebounds and three steals. Marquese Chriss continued his recent stretch of excellent play with 23 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and one block.

The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end.

The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game. The one bright spot was the bench, as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together. Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game.

The game was largely a tale of two halves, with New York dominating the first two quarters despite missing two starters on offense, and jumping out to a 46 - 35 lead by intermission. However, the Lakers battled back through the final two periods, and the two teams found themselves knotted at 87 with 29 seconds left. Neither club could find a way to break the tie over the ensuing 28 ticks of the clock, with Kobe Bryant failing to hit a 12 - foot jumper for the Lakers after a 19 - second possession.

The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead, but blew it in the second half with some bad defense. The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game. The one bright spot was the bench, as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together. Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game. This was a brutal loss for Nuggets fans and they'll look to bounce - back on Wednesday when they take on the Phoenix Suns.

Following a Wizards bucket, Rondo and Cousins appeared to mock the refs, walking towards their bench both clapping simultaneously. Rondo was then ejected for arguing with the ref, and Cousins earned his 16th technical foul of the season. If all holds up, both players will likely be suspended for their next game. Despite the strange ending, the Kings had little trouble handling their opponent on the second game of a back - to - back for Washington. The first quarter went in favor of the Wizards, and John Wall got them off to a hot start after scoring seven points and adding four rebounds and four assists in that first period. Wall is accustomed to dealing dimes against Sacramento, his season high 19 assists came against the Kings late in December. From there on out Cousins went on to score at will and abuse his matchup with Marcin Gortat.

"report_38.txt","The Phoenix Suns (34 - 32) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14 - 49) 106 - 97 on Wednesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix. The Suns got out to a quick start in this one, grabbing a 25 - 18 lead right away after the first quarter. It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game, but the Suns were able to pull off a huge win, as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Suns were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 44 percent from the floor and a disgraceful eight percent from beyond the arc. The Suns were led by Markieff Morris, who finished with a team - high of 24 points (10 - 15 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), to go along with three rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. It was a very nice bounce - back outing for the forward, as he posted just four points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field during Monday's game against the Warriors. He's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year. Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe, who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and nine assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games. The Suns gained even more of an advantage from their bench in the win, as they were extremely productive. Rookie T.J. Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points (8 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) in just 19 minutes. The Suns drafted him knowing he could score at a high rate, so it's not surprising he was finally able to show a little more of what he's got. Marcus Thornton also reached double figures off the bench, with 14 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and four rebounds in 22 minutes. Kevin Martin did his best to keep the Timberwolves in this game. He went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 6 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 16 points. After shooting just 25 percent (2 - 8 FG) from the field in Monday's game against the Clippers, it was good to see him hit on such a high percentage of shots Wednesday. In a solid performance off the bench, Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points, while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves, as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season. With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season. In 29 minutes, he finished with 10 points (3 - 9 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds. Andrew Wiggins did n't have much of an impact either, as he also had just 10 points (5 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt) and four rebounds. The Suns' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Friday.

While the Magic were able to out - rebound the Bulls 45 - 35, they were forced into 18 turnovers, which may have been just enough to push the Bulls to win number 32 on the season and keep them a half game ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division.

Butler was all over the place, recording a team - high of 27 points (9 - 16 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), to go along with five assists and an impressive six steals. He's played extremely well of late, averaging 24 points, 4 steals and 4 assists over his last three games. The six steals also matched a season - high. Gasol, on the other hand, posted 25 points (10 - 16 FG, 5 - 6 FT) and 15 rebounds in 37 minutes. It was his twelfth double - double in a row, pushing his season averages to 18 points and 12 rebounds per game. While slightly over - shadowed by the performances of Butler and Gasol, Joakim Noah had a large impact on this game. He finished with 18 points (7 - 10 FG, 4 - 4 FT), nine rebounds and two steals. It matched a season - high in points for him as well and was great for his confidence offensively, as he had combinded for only three points over his last two games. Derrick Rose notched a double - double with 10 points (4 - 14 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and 11 assists. The Magic saw six players reach double figures in points, including all five of their starters, but still were n't able to hold off the Bulls. Victor Oladipo finished with a team - high of 18 points (8 - 16 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), while also adding six assists and two steals. He continues to make a nice contribution defensively, as it was his third straight game recording two steals. He's now averaging 17 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists on the year. Tobias Harris nearly recorded a double - double, posting 15 points (6 - 17 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), eight rebounds and three steals. He's had a nice three - game stretch where he's averaged 24 points and 8 rebounds per game. The ever so consistent Nikola Vucevic had somewhat of a down game, totaling 14 points (5 - 14 FG, 4 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds in 32 minutes. It was his lowest scoring output since January ninth against the Lakers, so it came quite unexpected. Coming off the bench, Evan Fournier was very efficient with his time and posted 14 points (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), three rebounds and three assists in only 18 minutes. The Magic's next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Bulls will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday.
