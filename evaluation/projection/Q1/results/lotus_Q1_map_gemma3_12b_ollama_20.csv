While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons.

After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals. The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.

The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists.

He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals. The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.

The Greek Freak scored a game - high 34 points on top of 12 rebounds, five assists, five steals and two blocked shots. Fellow young star Jabari Parker posted 18 points of his own, while Michael Beasley had one of his best performances of the season off the bench, scoring 17 points. As a team, the Bucks put together one of their best shooting nights of the year, as they shot an astounding 54 percent from the floor. For the Cavaliers, it was one of their more uninspiring performances of the season, as they lacked much energy and settled for a lot of 3 - point shots. As a team, 39 of their 75 shots came from behind the arc. LeBron James led the way with 22 points, four rebounds and four assists, while Kyrie Irving added 20 points. Kevin Love was the only other Cavalier to score in double figures, as he posted a double - double of 13 points and 13 rebounds. Cleveland had won four in a row and seven of their last eight before Tuesday night, however, and still sit comfortable as the top team in the Eastern Conference. Up next, the Bucks will head to Brooklyn on Thursday to take on the Nets, while the Cavaliers will go home Thursday and play the Clippers.

44,6,Kevin Love,"The second - seed Cleveland Cavaliers (40) completed their sweep of the seventh - seed Boston Celtics (0 - 4) in a 101 - 93 slugfest Sunday. Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.

Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own. Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game. Bryant finished with 17 points, one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting, but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times, which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game. The Lakers will visit the Utah Jazz (36 - 37) on Monday, while the Wizards will head north to take on the Golden State Warriors (66 - 7).

With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists. This marks the final regular season game for both teams, but each will head into the playoffs which start this weekend.

125,15,Ramon Sessions,"The Cleveland Cavaliers (53 - 29) defeated the Washington Wizards (46 - 36) 113 - 108 on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists. This marks the final regular season game for both teams, but each will head into the playoffs which start this weekend.

126,16,Kobe Bryant,"The Los Angeles Lakers (5 - 23) defeated the Denver Nuggets (11 - 17) 111 - 107 on Tuesday night. The game was a tale of two halves, as these teams showed why they have struggled so much this season. The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead, but blew it in the second half with some bad defense. The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game. The one bright spot was the bench, as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together. Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game. This was a brutal loss for Nuggets fans and they'll look to bounce - back on Wednesday when they take on the Phoenix Suns.
