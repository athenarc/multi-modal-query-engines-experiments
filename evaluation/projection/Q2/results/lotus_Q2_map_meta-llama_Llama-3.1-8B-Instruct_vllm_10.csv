The total points scored by the Cavaliers are not explicitly mentioned in the Report, but we can calculate it as follows: 

LeBron James (22) + Kyrie Irving (20) + Kevin Love (13) = 55 points

However, the Report mentions that the Cavaliers scored 75 points in total. Therefore, the remaining points were scored by other players. 

75 (total points) - 55 (points scored by LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love) = 20 points
