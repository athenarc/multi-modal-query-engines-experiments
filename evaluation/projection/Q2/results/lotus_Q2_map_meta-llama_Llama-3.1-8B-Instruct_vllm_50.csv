The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well.

Matt Barnes parlayed his rare starting opportunity into a solid tally of 14 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals over 38 minutes. Jeff Green acquitted himself well filling in at power forward for the ailing Zach Randolph (knee), pitching in 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of blocks in a tough matchup against Nowitzki.

The Warriors shot 41 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc, with both numbers notably lower than their respective 49 and 42 season figures in those categories. Cleveland fared even worse, draining only 32 percent of their buckets overall, including a paltry 17 percent from long range. Both teams' point totals were also season - low tallies, underscoring how formidable both defensive units can be against top - tier competition. The Cavs were led by Lebron James' game - high 25 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and a pair of blocks. Despite the solid scoring total, the perennial All-Star was one of the superstars struggling with his shot, sinking only 10 of his 26 attempts. J.R. Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal.

Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting.

The Heat resume play after the All-Star break in Atlanta on February 24th when they'll do battle with the Hawks. The Rockets will next take the floor in New Orleans against the Pelicans on Thursday, February 23rd.
","To find the number of wins for the Houston Rockets in the game, we need to look at the report. The report states that the Houston Rockets had 40 wins and 18 losses. 

So, the number of wins for the Houston Rockets is 40.","To find the number of losses for the Houston Rockets, we need to look at the Report. 

The Report states that the Heat had ""two consecutive losses coming in to Wednesday"" and that the Heat ""assured themselves of heading into the All-Star break on a positive note with a spectacular shooting night and consistent effort across all four quarters"" after the game against the Rockets. This implies that the Rockets won the game, and the Heat's two consecutive losses were before this game.

However, the Report does not explicitly state the number of losses for the Rockets. It only mentions the Heat's losses. 

But we can infer that the Rockets won the game, and the Heat lost the game. So, the Rockets' win count is 1, and the Heat's loss count is 2. 

Since the Rockets won the game, we can infer that the Rockets' loss count is 18 (as mentioned in the Report: ""The Rockets (40 - 18)""), and the Heat's win count is 25 (as mentioned in the Report: ""The Heat (25 - 32)""), and the Heat lost the game, so the Heat's loss count is 32 - 25 = 7. 

However, the question asks for the number of losses for the Rockets. The Report does not explicitly state the number of losses for the Rockets, but it does mention that the Rockets have 40 wins and 18 losses. 

So, the number of losses for the Rockets is 18. 

Here is the code to get the answer:

The Pelicans out - rebounded the Nuggets 48 - 39, but it was n't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance, as they dropped a tough loss at home. Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 20 points.

Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate. Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11 - 22 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25 - point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds.
