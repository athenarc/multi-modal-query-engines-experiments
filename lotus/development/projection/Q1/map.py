The Bucks showed superior shooting, going 46 percent from the field, while the Knicks went only 41 percent from the floor. The Bucks also out - rebounded the Knicks 48 - 36, giving them in an even further advantage which helped them secure the 13 - point victory on the road. Brandon Knight led the Bucks again in this one. He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 17 points, while also handing out five assists. He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double - double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster were n't able to limit him. Notching a double - double of his own, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded 16 points (6 - 9 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT) and 12 rebounds.

He went 6 - for - 8 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 15 points in 20 minutes. The Knicks really struggled to score without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire.

Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28.

It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to.
