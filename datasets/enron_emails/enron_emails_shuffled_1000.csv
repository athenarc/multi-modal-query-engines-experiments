if this has not been done - i would like to know who is requesting phillip is retained . i spoke to john who was not aware of the issues - he does feel that this tax year is out of the question . but going forward this should be an issue - john was also unaware of the advice i had been given which is clearly incorrect .
why did i receive no response to this email should the action i requested not have been implemented .

i have recently had some very bad experiences with philip ' s advice and suggest that he is removed from enron ' s account completely . obviously david has had him removed from working on anything this side of the atlantic .
i feel strongly that enron employees should not be exposed to the potential liabilities which could be incurred through incorrect advice and would suggest your side of the water remove him also in the interests of enron as a whole .
if you want to know the details let me know . let me know if you have problems removing him and i will further explain why i think our individuals are at risk .

overviewstonebridge resources exploration ltd .
( nasd pink : sbgx ) , is a nevada corporation listed on the nasdaq pink
sheets . the company is focused on resource acquisition and development for
interests located primarily in canada and the united states . the company has
begun an intensive campaign to acquire and develop high value base metals , gold
and rare earth bearing properties . the company has a strategy to acquire a large
number of high value properties and begin development of them commencing
immediately . the initial target acquisitions all have very high potential for
moving into production and produce substantial income and profits . a private
funding group has agreed to finance acquisition and development of the initial
properties under friendly terms which involve a working interest in the
properties and equity in the company .
value resources has a
highly talented management group with many years of experience in resource
property development . the target portfolio of initial acquisition candidates has
a diverse and robust mix of deposits , some of very high value . one target
acquisition , for example , has a large deposit of scandium . scandium is a very
expensive rare earth material which has been used by the russian materials
industry in alloy with aluminum to coat the surface of aircraft . currently there
is no scandium mined in the free world , and the property that stonebridge plans
to develop contains large reserves of scandium and titanium . the company plans
to develop properties with many diverse resources such as copper , gold , zinc ,
talc , platinum and palladium amongst others . stonebridge has an initial
plan to acquire at least ten and as many as twenty valuable mining properties
within a very short timeframe . in the next several months sbgx plans to control
at least a dozen high - value mining properties with the potential to bring in
many millions of dollars of profit to the company . the exact extent of the
potential revenues is as yet undermined because , although most of the candidate
properties have known reserves , more exploration and drilling needs to be
conducted in order to determine the minimum value of the mining operations once
acquisition is complete . even after exploration , the potential exists to uncover
undiscovered reserves with the potential to multiply the known value of
the candidate acquisitions . one target acquisition is about 10 kilometers
southwest of timmins , ontario . the property already has indicated probable
reserves of 100 , 000 ounces with grades of 0 . 3 ounces per ton . this medium grade
ore in large volume constitutes a substantial deposit . exploration is ongoing at
the site and the company already has a joint venture partner lined up for
development once the acquisition is completed . the company has a strategy to
develop properties in joint ventures with large mining interests . this strategy
allows the company to leverage its capital and proceed with development quickly
on all properties simultaneously . the company has at least ten gold bearing
sites under review for acquisition at this time .
 resources is building a
large and well funded mining concern with substantial acquisition properties in
various stages of development . the strategy of developing diverse properties
with various types of rare earth , gold and mineral deposits insures that there
is robust and lasting value built into the company . moreover the chances of
uncovering greater value as development continues increases as the variety and
extent of the deposits become fully known . stonebridge plans to develop these
properties and get them into production as soon as possible . the company
is well funded by investors who care for the long - term viability of the company
and who will act in the best interests of the shareholders . gmcr expects that
stonebridge will realize sizeable profits of many millions of dollars from the
development of these initial candidate properties . moreover , gmcr expects that
the company will continue to expand through acquisition and become a major
mining concern throughout north america .

stonebridge signs loi to acquire 50 % interest in mining
claims of 6070205 canada inc . friday april 29 , 4 : 01 pm
et
carson city , nev . - - ( business wire ) - - april 29 , 2005 - - stonebridge
resources explorations ltd . ( nqb : sbgx - news ) , has entered into a
letter of intent with 6070205 canada inc . to acquire 50 % interest in the mining
claims of their property in northern ontario , 15 km n . w . of kirkland lake .
the property was explored previously by a number of companies and previous
drilling indicated geology finds that are favorable for a potential large
sulphite deposit .
the initial drilling done in 1998 indicated zinc mineralization in a number
of drill holes , varying from 0 . 6 meters of 4 . 4 % zinc and 1 . 76 % zinc over 4 . 6
meters , 1 . 33 % zinc over 4 meters .
in the year 2002 a megatem airborne survey was conducted over the property
identifying several areas of interest . a confirmation of the geophysical result
from the airborne survey was obtained by a ground geophysical survey that
identified the down plunge extension of the previous drilling . it was
recommended that a 3 drill hole program for a total of 500 meters be undertaken .
harold pizel , stonebridge resources president , said ; "" this agreement signed
once again shows our strong belief and commitment to the mineral rich northern
ontario region , we are excited about the opportunities ahead . ""

ivonne ,
i am currently enrolled in a french language class thru enron and melly ' s
language services , and my group is paying the cost directly .
i am considering quitting the melly ' s language program in favor of an outside
private tutor , for a number of reasons . it will be cheaper too .
i would like to know :
1 . does enron have a contract in place with melly ' s language service , to be
the exclusive provider of language services to enron ?
2 . will enron pay the costs of my language classes if they are held outside
of the melly contract ( if any ) ?
i just want to make sure that if i decide to "" drop out "" of the melly classes
and sign up for other private tutoring courses , which will be less expensive
than the melly svc , that enron will not have a problem picking up the tab .
vince kaminski , the md , wants to know this , to ensure there is no legal
restriction on who must provide these language services in order to secure
enron reimbursement .
thanks for your help .

13,5193,vince and vasant :,"here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany , capacity trader at
the east desk , related to gas transmission :
typically , pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis . an example
might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn , where you might pay
$ 12 . 00 per month per 10 , 000 decatherms of capacity ( $ 0 . 40 per day ) , a fixed
payment . variable charges are 6 % for fuel costs ( "" shrinkage "" ) and 6 . 5 % for
overhead expenses . a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of nymex - $ 0 . 10 ( "" basis "" ) , and might call brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of nymex + $ 0 . 25 . the trader ' s spread is
$ 0 . 35 , and variable costs of transmission are $ 0 . 125 , so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $ 0 . 225 for firm capacity tomorrow .
as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible , the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm - equivalent of interruptible capacity .
also , many pipelines don ' t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
( "" it ' s not worth their time to haggle "" ) ( there is a further issue of
"" secondary markets "" not important to the model yet ) . for south texas and
brooklyn , there are several different routes the gas can physically take
( pipelines of enron , texas eastern , etc ) . and , once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the ( enron ) positions on each end of the pipeline ,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts .
clayton",ham,1999-12-16
14,7626,marketpoint license agreement,"john / vince :
i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross
section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people .
as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for
marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your
consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire
bundled product , which includes
? north american gas , short and long term
? north american electricity , short and long term
? world gas
? western european gas
? world oil
we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european
gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into
marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of
months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are
presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an
attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout
your worldwide business .
as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will
want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at
the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately
the fully
bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the
software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the
electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas
model plus the data for
the software license plus the data license for a
total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under
the fully bundled price . i
think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from
marketpoint  , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward
together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to  & scale up  8 to another
model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you
up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas
decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put
this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move
forward . )
i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our
approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you
might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you
were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same
time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the
benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a
complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i
would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i
look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as
a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to
earn and secure your business .
if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount
marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you
begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1
day training seminar .
our clients are usually very fluent after that 1
day training seminar .
thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a
few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable
before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks
later .
thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that
i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show
anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the
meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .

i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 "" long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5 ""
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 "" long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !

the davis administration , stung by charges of excessive secrecy , disclosed late friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances .
a sixth consultant hired to help california purchase electricity has quit , according to state records .
all were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned .
in addition , the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled .
top advisors to gov . gray davis told the times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week , after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements . a review of those documents , which included stock holdings , showed that some of the consultants "" may have crossed the line , "" said the governor ' s senior advisor , nancy mcfadden .
state law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests .
although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence , the governor has not required some of his most influential private - sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings .
among them are two wall street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor ' s energy rescue plan , which includes the largest state bond sale in u . s . history .
the new york firms that employ executives joseph fichera and michael hoffman have been paid $ 275 , 000 a month to , among other things , help pitch the $ 12 . 5 - billion bond issue to wall street analysts and state lawmakers . the companies stand to make an additional $ 14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines .
davis contends that fichera , hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor , beyond the reach of the state ' s political reform laws . critics question the distinction .
"" the governor ' s approach may be convenient for him , "" said jim knox , executive director of the watchdog group california common cause , "" but it ignores the law . ""
disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "" decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest , "" knox said . "" trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing . ""
the firings disclosed friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year .
more than $ 25 million is being spent by the state on consultants , according to state records .
in the process , seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws .
it took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances , including investments . the state political reform act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies .
even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far , the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted . most of the consultants , for example , failed to state when they bought the energy stocks .
one of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is secretary of state bill jones , a republican who hopes to challenge davis next year . jones has accused the governor of "" a conscious policy of secrecy "" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws . this week jones called for a federal securities and exchange commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants .
4 traders owned shares of calpine
the four traders removed this week all owned shares of calpine corp . , a san jose - based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $ 43 billion in long - term state power contracts . their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $ 100 , 000 , records show .
while working for the state department of water resources , officials said they bought undetermined amounts of calpine power on the state ' s behalf . more than $ 14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by calpine in the first quarter of this year , according to the most recent records available .
"" we did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks , "" the governor ' s legal affairs secretary , barry goode , said in an interview .
the highest - ranking consultant removed , richard ferreira , was hired on a $ 500 , 000 contract in january to assist in obtaining bids for long - term power and negotiating contracts , records show .
a former assistant general manager with the sacramento municipal utility district , ferreira was paid $ 200 an hour by the state . after he disclosed owning as much as $ 10 , 000 in calpine stock , officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company ' s contracts . ferreira could not be reached for comment .
the governor ' s office identified the other four as traders william f . mead , herman leung , constantine louie and peggy cheng , most of whom could not be reached friday by the times .
all of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the power exchange , a now - defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of california ' s electricity deregulation .
hired by the state in february and march , the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $ 15 , 000 and $ 21 , 000 a month , including living expenses in sacramento and flights home to southern california .
mead , 55 , a former edison engineer , said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago .
he said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1 / 2 years ago for $ 12 , 000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times , doubling in value each time .
mead said he was called by the head of the state ' s energy buying team thursday and fired .
"" i asked very directly , ' is this because of the stock ? ' and they wouldn ' t give me an answer , "" mead said . "" [ he ] just said your services are terminated .
"" i came up here , away from home , living in a hotel room , trying to keep the lights on , trying to get the state through a crisis and now i get a finger pointed at me as if i ' m some sort of criminal . i guess it ' s just politics and we ' re the pawns . ""
administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders , including one who bought calpine stock just before beginning work for the state . that trader , elaine griffin , who also came from the power exchange , left the state power buying operation july 14 , three days after disclosing her energy industry investment . griffin , who the governor ' s office said had obtained another job , could not be reached for comment .
griffin reported purchasing $ 10 , 000 to $ 100 , 000 of calpine stock on feb . 1 , in her final days working at the electricity exchange .
a few days later , calpine signed and announced a $ 4 . 6 - billion , 10 - year deal to sell power to the department of water resources .
on feb . 20 , griffin joined the state power buying agency , just as the state and calpine were finalizing an additional $ 8 . 3 billion in power contracts . one of those , a 20 - year deal signed feb . 27 , was the longest .
the state has awarded calpine about $ 13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years .
in addition to the state consultants who bought calpine stock , two others reported owning stock in texas - based power marketing giant enron corp . and two more bought stock in southern california edison , the faltering utility that davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy .
another consultant bought stock in reliant energy of houston , a large power plant operator that bought several california plants from utilities after deregulation .
bernard barretto , an energy trader , who buys energy on the daily spot market , said in an interview that he bought about $ 2 , 000 in enron stock shortly before he began work for the state feb . 28 .
purchase of enron stock defended
"" i don ' t see a conflict , "" he said . "" at the time , we weren ' t really dealing with enron . i [ still ] haven ' t bought from enron . ""
barretto said he never considered his enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice july 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job .
that notice came from goode , the governor ' s lawyer .
"" we expect and have always expected the state ' s consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards , "" he wrote . "" that standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters . ""
"" therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today . if he or she refuses , the state will sever its contract with that person . ""
however , the governor ' s office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors , fichera and hoffman .
davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney raquelle de la rocha , a former member of the los angeles ethics commission and the state fair political practices commission . she concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors , not consultants , and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects .
fichera is davis ' point man on the governor ' s energy rescue plan - - including the unprecedented bond sale . he has pitched the plan to lawmakers , reporters and the wall street financial community . fichera refused to comment on the record .
fichera and hoffman ' s companies , saber partners and blackstone group , prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure , intended to pay for past and future power buying .
pact specifies financial advice
the state ' s contract with the fichera and hoffman firms calls for them to provide "" financial advisory services "" to the state .
the decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with montague derose and associates . that consulting firm was hired on a $ 1 . 8 - million contract . like the other two firms , it too was hired to provide "" financial advisory services "" to the state .
that firm ' s top advisor , douglas s . montague , was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement . he reported no power company interests .
the governor ' s legal advisors said the difference is that montague is on a longer contract .

dear friend ,
permit me to inform you of my desire of going into
business relationship with you .
i am mr andy monga , the only son of late mr and mrs
banabas monga . my father was a very wealthy cocoa
merchant in abidjan , the economic capital of ivory
coast , my father was poisoned to death by his business
associates in one of their outings on a business trip .
my mother died when i was a baby and since then , my
father took me so special . before the death of my
father on january 2002 in a private hospital here in
abidjan , he secretly called me on his bedside and told
me that he has the sum of eighteen million , five
hundred
thousand us dollars ( us $ 18 , 500 , 000 ) left in a fixed /
suspense account in one of the prime banks here in
abidjan , that he used my name as his only son for the
next of kin in depositing the fund . he also
explained to me that it was because of this wealth
that he was poisoned by his business associates . that
i should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my
choice where i will transfer this money and use it for
investment purpose such as real estate management or
hotel management .
i am honourably seeking your assistance in the
following ways :
1 ) to serve as a guardian of this fund since i am only
20 years old
2 ) to make arrangement for me to come over to your
country to further my education and to secure a
resident permit for me in your country .
moreover , i am willing to offer you 15 % of the
total sum as compensation for your effort / input after
the successful transfer of this fund into your
nominated account overseas and 5 % for expenses .
furthermore , you indicate your options towards
assisting me as i believe that this transaction would
be concluded within ( 24 ) days you signify
interest to assist me .

hi , vince please put your best effort in making sure that we differentiate
summer interns and associates that ebs research will be hiring . i am talking
about compensation here . ken rice mentioned that ebs is in the process of
developing a technical equivalent of our aa pool . ebs research people can
potentially rotate through this pool in the future . i just don ' t want to
risk losing people like giuseppe ( & get the word out that we are low - ballers )
because we have to fit them into certain set of categories that was designed
for the energy business . i realize that you have estabilished such
differentiation for research as a whole , but i think that would have to be
moved up a notch in the case of ebs .

you may not find the details of the update to be that exciting , i want you to
know that much work and time are being put into this effort . paul and gregor
are the two desk directors for continental power who report to joe gold .
it ' s good to hear some feedback from them .
as you know , kristin has now shown some interest in the ebs job with barry
now that fallen is moving . when barry and i first spoke about the position
which i would fill , i told him the fallen might want kristin since he knows
her and has worked with her the last 2 years . although the job sounds
interesting ( barry ' s a good salesman ) , there is not room for both kristin and
myself . i ' ll keep you updated on my discussions with barry .

dear sir / madam
we want to transfer to overseas the sum of eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from a bank in africa .
i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money , though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in time to come .
i am mr . edward moko . the external auditor of a bank . during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1998 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account gain . after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a "" heir apparent to the throne "" hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . the owner of this account who is mr . eshed . b . willey , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since 1998 , until now no other person ( s ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that eshed . b . willey until his death was the manager oriental diamond company , in south africa . however , if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with thirty four point two million u . s . dollars ( u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you . we shall also re - apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account . while the total amount involved is eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) only . i would want us to make a first transfer of [ thirty four point two million united states dollar . u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest . i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign "" agreement "" , but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in u . s . dollars and the former owner of the account mr . eshed . b . willey is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account . however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards .
as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments , i need your full co - operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process .
i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .
respectfully

93,11787,canfibre,"we have an agreement in principle for a resolution of our investment entanglement at canfibre riverside and canfibre lackawanna :
there will be no draw on the $ 4 . 5 million enron obligation to fund lackawanna based upon acceptance tests .
any such funding would have benefited only the senior lenders at this facility ( of which we are not one ) .
there will be complete release of enron and subsidiaries for any claims , including underwriters ' liability relating
to enron ' s promotion and sale of the lackawanna bonds . this release will cover any current or past contracts
or agreements at any time related to our investment and ownership . it does not include potential claims on the
power contract at riverside that was terminated when that company went into bankruptcy . this contract could
not be included since all the unsecured creditors at riverside are stakeholders .
enron will receive $ 250 k in cash .
in return :
enron will assign the canfibre loans and the stock of the canfibre group to the senior bondholders .
enron ' s investment in the loans and stock included in this deal were written - off totally last year . we were facing an additional potential write - off of $ 4 . 5 million this year relating to the lackawanna additional funding . in addition to the $ 4 . 8 million hard - dollar recovery , this transaction avoids a very real , substantial potential liability due to enron ' s heavy involvement ( and specific underwriting of lackawanna ) in the two canfibre deals in which well in excess of $ 200 million investment ( over $ 150 million of which came from third parties ) was lost in two catastrophic financial disasters . richard sanders has confirmed that getting rid of any claim on underwriters ' liability has significant value in this situation . we avoid continuing to incur substantial legal and professional expenses over a prolonged period . we terminate significant commercial and legal time and effort that is much more productively reassigned elsewhere .
if the deal is closed , i view this resolution as a grandslam home run in the bottom of the ninth . through a barrage of analyses and negotiation , john enerson managed to create some leverage where none existed that eventually forced the canfibre bondholders into finally recognising that we were more than ready to fight them aggressively on every issue by all means available and bring them to the table . in the end we got virtually everything we could possibly have obtained under any reasonable scenario . john has handled this deal with creativity and persistence and deserves credit for orchestrating a very sensitive situation . wayne mays from technical services provided key engineering support .
the documentation and closing of this transaction is scheduled to occur early next week . normally i would wait for closing to report success . since this deal was put together very rapidly , however , i wanted time to clarify any questions that might arise prior to final execution . of course , given that the status is agreement in principle , there is always the chance ( we believe it is highly unlikely ) that the deal could fall apart .",ham,2001-05-18

97,13842,sec information / earnings restatement,"today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;

- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .

we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments .",ham,2001-11-08

124,13999,lincoln electric,"louise ,
i understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the lincoln electric sales agreement to oppd is not sufficient to justify paying $ 1 . 3 million to oppd in order for them to assume this contract .
there are some considerations on this contract which i think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you :
- the original sales contract to lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as "" toxic waste "" .
- about a month ago , we agreed verbally with oppd to accept assignment of the sales contract , as oppd is one of the few parties which can serve it .
- the execution of the documents has been delayed by lincoln , who were initially refusing to consent to the assignment
- we have another , larger under - water transaction with oppd which we would like to move off the books at some point . we ' d like to keep oppd happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to them )
- if we fail to deliver , we will be subject to penalties in the amount of $ 45 , 0000 per mw on top of liquidated damages ( lincoln is 15 mw for 02 and 30 mw for 03 ) .
- this is a highly constrained area ( only 6 counterparties can physically deliver in this area and oppd is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve lincoln ) : the chance that we will be unable to deliver is high .
- there is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where enron fails to deliver .
- even if we do wind up serving the contract , the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquire .
- trading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve ( day - ahead notice on 20 % monthly load factor )
obviously , if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now , then we will smooth things as much as possible with oppd - but i wanted to make sure you had all the info . before we kill the deal .
terri has stalled oppd until monday .

new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - enron corp . ' s share price hovered above seven - year lows touched in earlier trade monday after moody ' s investor service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of north america ' s largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status .
enron , the largest electricity and natural gas trader in north america , also on monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks .
enron shares were down $ 1 . 40 , or 9 . 03 percent , to $ 14 . 10 on the new york stock exchange , after earlier in the session trading below $ 14 for the first time since december 1994 .
moody ' s also warned that it could cut the debt rating again , now downgraded to baa 2 , as well as its rating for the enron ' s commercial paper .
enron ' s credit - worthiness will have a direct affect on its day - to - day trading operations and its trading partners ' perception of making good on trades . with a credit rating hovering above junk status , the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades .
last week enron shares lost almost $ 14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company ' s involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out .
investors have fled enron ' s stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off - the - balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow in deals the u . s . securities and exchange commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest .
enron compensated its partners in this off - balance sheet structure with the promise of enron shares , if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level .
many industry observers see enron ' s request for additional credit , after the company tapped its banks for $ 3 . 3 billion last week , as a sign a weakness .
"" we are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one ' s backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength , but instead . . . it ' s an act of desperation , "" said carol levenson , an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit . com .

usa : us companies ' credit quality to worsen - moody ' s .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - u . s . corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better , a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on monday .
moody ' s investors service said that in the third quarter , it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 u . s . companies . at the same time , it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies .
that 5 . 5 - to - 1 ratio is far greater than the 1 . 3 - to - 1 ratio in the second quarter .
in dollar terms , the situation looks more dire . moody ' s warned it may downgrade $ 543 billion of debt , dwarfing the $ 66 billion moody ' s said it may upgrade by 8 . 2 - to - 1 .
"" particularly in light of september 11 , the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes , "" said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . "" a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year . ""
rating reviews are significant because , unlike actual rating changes , they are not a "" lagging "" indicator , and suggest the future direction of corporate credit . moody ' s normally wraps up its reviews within three months .
u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening u . s . economy , an inability of marginal companies to raise cash , debt - financed merger activity and fallout from the sept . 11 attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance , and travel .
for example , moody ' s in july warned it may cut comcast corp . ' s ratings after the philadelphia - based company bid $ 44 . 5 billion for at & t corp . ' s cable tv operations .
then last month , moody ' s warned it may cut chicago - based boeing co . ' s ratings because of the attacks ' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes .
in the third quarter , moody ' s warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative - grade , or "" junk "" - rated , companies , and raise the ratings of just 11 . for investment - grade companies , the gap was even more yawning : 68 - to - 11 .
and in the fourth quarter ? through friday , moody ' s warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four . on monday , it downgraded embattled energy trading giant enron corp . , and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade .
puchalla , however , said the decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively .
"" lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , "" he said . "" that is a positive for credit quality . ""
the third quarter was the 14 th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades . the record is 19 quarters , set between 1988 and 1993 .

enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( updatel )
2001 - 10 - 29 12 : 16 ( new york )
enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( updatel )
( updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph . )
houston , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , which can ' t get
low - interest , short - term loans , faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank , credit analysts said .
` ` anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous , ' ' said
sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . ` ` it ' s
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral . ' '
enron is trying to get $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in loans from
citigroup inc . , j . p . morgan chase & co . and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company ' s stock since
oct . 17 , the wall street journal reported . the company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners .
the company on thursday tapped $ 3 . 3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $ 2 billion in commercial paper ,
or short - term corporate loans . a week ago , the enron said the u . s .
securities and exchange commission had began an inquiry into
related - party transactions . they cost the company $ 35 million and
$ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder equity .
` ` banks are in the driver ' s seat , and enron is a little
desperate , ' ' said peter petas , a debt analyst at creditsights inc .
` ` i think their interest rates for loans would go up . ' '
sells assets for cash
companies in enron ' s situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans , petas said . those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral .
enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash . two related
partnerships , osprey and marlin , depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $ 3 . 3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants . enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds .
the company plans to complete the $ 2 . 9 billion sale of
portland general electric , an oregon utility , to northwest natural
gas co . next year .
shares of houston - based enron fell $ 1 . 30 , or 8 . 4 percent , to
$ 14 . 10 in midday trading . earlier , they touched $ 13 . 55 , down 12
percent . the company ' s credit rating was cut by moody ' s investors
service after it wrote down the value of its assets .
the stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months .

power points : enron may have to rethink asset - light focus

a dow jones newswires column
new york - ( dow jones ) - on the face of things , it ' s hard to understand the stock market ' s headspinning reaction to enron corp . ' s ( ene ) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks .
why the talk of a "" death spiral "" for north america ' s premier energy trading company ? the stock price of cisco systems inc . ( csco ) , for example , saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12 - month period . nobody questioned the viability of cisco .
the difference is that over the past few years , enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question .
if you ' re buying network components , you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier . after all , you ' re buying something you can touch . but if you ' re buying power or gas , what you ' re really buying is a commitment to deliver . if your supplier doesn ' t come through when the market gets tough , you ' re left totally exposed . in enron ' s energy trading business , then , credibility at every level is critical .
for now , enron looks to be more than viable . but the company ' s asset - light strategy might not be . gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1 . 65 % in the third quarter from 5 . 26 % in the first quarter of 1998 . meanwhile , asset - heavy energy companies like mirant corp . ( mir ) and calpine corp . ( cpn ) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure .
two weeks ago , enron reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss , resulting from $ 1 . 01 billion in write - offs . that didn ' t send investors running , however . in fact , its stock price rose a bit on the news .
what hurt was the disclosure that enron had reduced its net assets , or "" shareholders ' equity , "" by $ 1 . 2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former chief financial officer andrew fastow . that , along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the securities 201 - 938 - 4604 ; mark . golden @ dowjones . com

( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
( moody ' s corrected its stance on enron ratings to a downgrade )
new york ( afx ) - moody ' s investors service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long - term debt ratings of enron corp from baal to baa 2 following a deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments .
the long - term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade , moody ' s said .
moody ' s also placed the company ' s prime - 2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade .
moody ' s initially placed enron ' s long - term debt ratings on review on oct 16 . the write - downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of enron ' s share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper , according to moody ' s .
in response to these events , moody ' s said enron has shored up its near - term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper , leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1 . 2 bln usd .
moody ' s said it plans to focus on management ' s success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties .

new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - moody ' s investors service on monday cut embattled energy trading giant enron corp . ' s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status , and warned it may cut that rating again , as well as its rating for enron ' s commercial paper .
the rating agency cut houston - based enron ' s senior unsecured debt to "" baa 2 "" from "" baal , "" and said it may cut enron ' s "" prime - 2 "" commercial paper rating , which affects short - term debt . its rating actions affect $ 13 billion .

uk : europe energy firms wary of enron on credit worries .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , oct 29 ( reuters ) - energy companies in europe are shying away from trading with troubled u . s . energy group enron amid concerns about the company ' s credit status , industry sources said on monday .
several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with enron - one of europe ' s biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the u . s . group about setting up new credit arrangements , the sources said .
"" i think enron ' s approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow , "" said the head of risk management at one uk utility that halted its trade with enron last week .
"" they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , "" he said . "" the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis . ""
a spokesman for enron ' s european headquarters in london headquarters declined to comment .
reluctance to trade with enron in europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five - year lows .
triggering the slide was news last week the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer .
houston - based enron trades a large amount of its volume in the u . s . and europe through its internet enrononline system .
last friday the company said trade on enrononline was above average levels with more than 8 , 400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $ 4 billion .
traders said enron ' s plight could hit liquidity in european gas and power markets , where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years .
one industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the uk electricity market had put on hold their trading enron , which is among the biggest five traders in the market .
in mainland europe , where enron has been a major driver of liquidity , potential counterparties are treading with care .
"" we are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a ' sleeve ' ( a third party trader ) , "" said a senior trader at one of germany ' s big utilities , who declined to be named .
french traders said wariness about dealing with enron had dampened liquidity although enron was still in the market on monday morning .
"" enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem , "" said one french trader .

bandwidth beat : enron puts spotlight back on broadband

a dow jones newswires column
houston - ( dow jones ) - thanks to enron corp . ( ene ) , the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money .
but it won ' t be traders who will cash in on this new potential . it will be class - action attorneys . they ' re already lining up to sue enron in at least five shareholder suits .
as of oct . 25 , two of lawsuits had been filed against enron in federal court and three more in texas state court . most of them name as defendants ken lay , enron ' s longtime chairman , former chief executive jeff skilling and andrew fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence oct . 25 .
still another suit , which isn ' t a class action suit , was filed naming as defendants members of enron ' s board of directors .
all the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships enron set up , many of them managed by fastow . most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with enron .
the transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband , water and other enron investments .
fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions . as enron ' s chief financial officer , he was being paid to manage the corporation ' s finances . as general partner of two ljm partnerships , he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with enron . he shared in profits of those partnerships .
when investors began demanding information about the transactions , enron ' s share price began to slide . with the heat on , enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $ 544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals , among other things .
that ' s when the class action attorneys went to work . so far , at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs . enron didn ' t respond to calls asking about the lawsuits .
among the law firms representing plaintiffs is milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach , which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit . the release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $ 30 billion from class action lawsuits .
the lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market . some of the deals with the ljm partnerships run by fastow "" purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market , "" according to abrams and franks v . enron et al .
that could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months . market skeptics have said enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth .
enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties , a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year , according to enron .
now market watchers will want to know if any of enron ' s trades were done with the ljm partnerships managed by fastow .
they will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with chewco investments . that houston company , according to a report in the wall street journal , was managed by michael kopper and was set up in 1997 when kopper was a managing director with enron ' s global equity markets group . he left enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by fastow .
do the plaintiffs ' attorneys know whether enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships ?

141,32233,escrow affiliate - part - time work at home opportunity,"baltia capital investment ltd . , the leading private equity investor in the
baltic states , offers you an opportunity to join our team on a position of escrow
affiliate . this home - based job does not require any in - depth knowledge of finance
or a great investment of time . if you believe that you are an orderly and
responsible person with some multi - task skills , this is a great opportunity for
you to get a substantial additional income without much effort .
looks like another work - by - email scam ? read on to find out why it is not .
about us
baltia capital investment was founded in 1995 to provide exciting investment
opportunities to institutions and individuals who believed in the potential of
the emerging markets of baltic states and former soviet union countries . over the
years , the performance of our funds remained ahead of the expectations of our
investors , and we have built a healthy reputation in the eastern european
investment market .
we are now looking at establishing local presence in the us and canada , where
household investors grow dissatisfied with the financial market performance and
standard investment vehicles . we are eager to offer private equity opportunities
that combine our investment expertise and the amazing potential of the emerging
markets . however , there is a major obstacle on our way : the 2001 patriot act . the
grievous events of the september 2001 were not only a display of great villainess
of the islamic fundamentalism , but also a catalyst for the us market being
effectively barred for the new european financial companies .
if you would like to learn more about our company , please feel free to visit us
online at www . baltiacapital . com .
how you can help
at the moment , us patriot act forbids international clients to hold bank
accounts in the us banks . all investment transactions made to eastern european
and baltic companies by individuals are also subject to great and often
unnecessary scrutiny , which brings a lot of inconvenience both to investment
companies and their clients . as a small company working on a highly competitive
market , we do not want to load our american clients , who are chiefly private ,
not - so - affluent investors with the additional expense associated with the upkeep
of a duly registered us office . that is why we are looking for escrow agents in
the usa and canada who will be able to receive the electronic bank payments on
behalf of our company and forward the funds to our client account , retaining an
escrow commission .
what you will need to do
as soon as you join our team , you will be assigned an online cabinet in our
corporate website employee section . there you will be able to trace all payments
made to your designated account for further transfer to the designated client
investment account . you will also see the amount of the commission due to you ,
calculated on the basis of your experience of successful cooperation with our
company . all you questions will be handled by your individual supervisor .
your reward
your escrow commission is calculated on the following table :
amount transferred , total commission rate
$ 50 , 000 - $ 150 , 000 12 , 5 %
$ 150 , 000 - $ 500 , 000 15 %
$ 500 , 000 and over 20 %
your escrow commission is deducted directly from the amount that you receive for
further transfer . that means that you do not have to wait till the end of the
month to receive your reward . instead , you receive the commission as soon as you
transfer the money to the client investment account .
example
jill escrow joins our company and receives a $ 35 , 000 payment from john investor
on the first week . her commission constitutes 10 % x $ 35 , 000 = $ 3500 . she retains
this amount and forwards the remaining $ 31 , 500 to the client investment account .
next week , she receives a $ 20 , 000 . her commission equals 10 % x $ 15 , 000 + 12 , 5 % x
$ 5 , 000 = $ 2125 .
whats next
if you are tempted by the offer , feel free to email a brief resume to
escrowprogram @ baltiacapital . com , and a
hr manager will be in touch with you shortly .

atmachambers & associates
solicitors herein after referred to as my client .
on the 21 st of october 2000 , my client , his wife valerie and their two children ( larry and daren ) died in an auto crash on one of nigerian roads . since then i have made several enquiries to the embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives without success . after several nsuccessful attempts , i decided to look for somebody abroad who is reliable and trustworthy i will forward as next of kin to receive his fund , hence i contacted you . i am contacting you to assist in claiming the money left behind by my client before the bank confiscates or declare the fund unserviceable . until his death , my client had , and maintained a us dollar currency deposit account with a closing balance of us $ 15 . 5 m ( fifteen million , five hundred thousand us dollars ) with the nigeria deposit insurance company who have written us to recover all such dormant and unclaimed accounts to reinvest it with other funds through the capital market , but we have cleverly written and asked them to release the f
und based on the instruction of the next of kin .
it is for the urgency of this claim that i write to you to stand and receive the money as mr . allen ' s next of kin since i have failed in attempts in locating the relatives for over 2 years now . i seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since i have perfectly procure all the vital documents that would aid the release of the money and forward it either to europe or america whereby you will receive the money . i am prepared to disburse the money among ourselves in the following ratio : beneficiary / next of kin 30 % , 10 % for bank and legal expenses , while my colleague and myself in the chambers shall have 60 % .
if this proposal is acceptable to you and you do not intend to take undue advantage of the trust we shall bestow on you , then kindly respond immediately , furnishing me with your confidential telephone and fax numbers . i have all necessary legal documents for the release of the fund . on indicating your willingness , i shall contact you for us to work out the modalities for you to receive the funds . all i require is your honesty and co - operation . i guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangements that will protect you from any breach of the law .

i have tentatively set the date for our first round - table discussion for
wednesday ,
december 20 th at 3 : 00 pm - 4 : 30 pm . the room , eb 3268 , will be available from
3 : 00 to 5 : 00 pm . if any of you have an issue with the date , please let me
know by
day ' s end .
professor don kouri of the physics department of the university of houston
will start
with an informal 30 - 45 minute presentation ( see appended abstract below ) of
his work
and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have .
professor kouri , please let me know if you have any requirements for
audiovisual
or other equipment .
this excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the
subject of our meeting :
[ . . . ] topics to
be discussed at a small ` ` roundtable ' ' format meeting , are :
1 . hdafs for data analysis , including ` ` gap - filling ' ' , data
extrapolation , denoising , mathematical manipulations of digital
data ( e . g . , taking derivatives , applying functions of differential
operators to digital data , etc . )
2 . hdafs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations , particularly for equations for which
existing methods encounter stability problems .
there are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
hdafs but i think that even trying to do both of the above in a
single meeting would be difficult . of course , in this first meeting
we would focus on general aspects of the hdafs that make them robust
for such applications . if , however , you have other topics in which
you are interested , i am willing to focus on them .

if you know of other interested parties , or want to substitute a proxy for
yourselves , please let me know .
this first meeting with dr . kouri will introduce the participants to his area
of research ( hdafs for data analysis ) and allow us to define the contents and
attendants of a seminar ( to come up soon ) .
we are looking to hold this discussion this week ( hopefully ) and to have the
seminar happen before christmas ( given that this is the in - between semester
season for schools ) .
a couple of other similar meetings will follow up : dr kevin bassler will be
talking about microscopic simulation of economic markets and dr . pinsky about
the effect of solar phenomena on the earth ' s atmosphere .

164,13467,re : management conference - business unit panel,"louise ,
i absolutely agree with you about the panels the last two years - - they have been weak . i think , though , that this should be looked at a little differently . the purpose for this is to highlight the operations of our business and to showcase the next level of leadership . i think rather than just focusing on one or two businesses , this format will allow us to hit each of them at a high level . mark will introduce each of you , talk a little about your backgrounds to help the vps get familiar with our new leadership , and interject questions and generate discussion as appropriate . to be honest , i see it as "" rapid fire business unit presentations "" as opposed to the typical panel .
let me know if you get a different sense from mark .

subject : management conference - business unit panel
hello all ,
i ' m planning the agenda for this year ' s management conference . i ' ve been working on the upcoming meeting since march , but as you can imagine , the direction has changed several times .
we are delighted to have general norman schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership , and gary hamel returning to help us process the past year . while we have arranged an all - star line up of outside speakers , we also want to focus on what is happening inside enron . rather than having only one or two business presentations , mark frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate .
currently , the panel is scheduled to take place 8 : 00 - 9 : 30 am on friday , november 16 . please plan to present a very high level overview of your business . you are welcome to use powerpoint slides , but in the interest of time , presentations must be no more than 10 minutes . mark will introduce each of you , interject questions , encourage interaction , and ensure we stay on time .
below is the proposed order for your presentations . regardless of your place in the rundown , you will need to be seated on stage by 7 : 50 am and equipped with a microphone . because we have a full agenda that morning , we will try to begin the session promptly at 8 : 00 am .
stan horton - global services
louise kitchen - americas
john sherriff - europe
mike mcconnell - global markets
jeff mcmahon - industrial markets
janet dietrich - retail
if you elect to use a powerpoint presentation , please forward it to me electronically by friday , november 9 or provide the presentation to me on cd at the management conference . to ensure consistancy , i ' ve attached a powerpoint template that i would like you to use .
>
finally , mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4 : 00 pm on wednesday , november 14 following your arrival at the management conference . the meeting will take place in the library off the main lobby of the westin la cantera . in the meantime , if you have any questions or need any assistance , please contact me . i look forward to working with you .

bobby ,
after meeting with cairn today in delhi , my perception is that our offer was
received well . they were more open and relaxed then they were on wed .
morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range , ( once we
talked through the price movements ) , and the seriousness of our gas related
activities on the west coast of india , in light of the ioc agreement . i
think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections
were raised . we did talk to some extent about the guarantees , but we didn ' t
get too far and they ' re willing to accept at this point that what ' s
acceptable to the lng suppliers , should be suitable for their needs .
however , they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of
enron energy marketing a little better and i told them i would get back to
them on that point .
david and ajay were up in hazira yesterday looking at some property for their
gas treatment facility , which apparently is across the road from pipeline
access . while there they went and looked at shell ' s proposed lng site after
walking the last 1 km , inaccessible to their 4 wd vehicle and not surprisingly
found a beach .
in summary , here is what we offered on a non - binding basis :
six year production plateau
85 % top
$ 3 . 67 / mmbtu net , at a base of $ 18 / bbl brent , with point of sale at the
tail - end of the gas processing plant
floor & cap of $ 15 . 50 - $ 27 . 00 / bbl
price movement : + / - $ 1 . 00 / bbl from the $ 18 / bbl base price ( on a 3 mo .
rolling average ) equals + / - $ 0 . 145 / mmbtu fixed on a quarterly basis
guarantees : same protection we ' re providing the lng suppliers under the
trust retention account
i appreciate everyone ' s help in submitting this offer .

169,23097,brent notes,"sally
here is a rough draft of my notes from our visit yesterday .
please read and see if it accurately reflects the essence of what you want to
communicate .
my suggestion is that you take the time early one evening and maybe visit
with brent off site . maybe over a
cocktail . i ' m sure you will be both serious and concerned
what you are doing is giving brent his year end review and basically asking
him to fill in the details with
actions over the next four to five months .
1 ) brent has a great opportunity to take his leadership skills to the next
level and by focusing and delivering
these challenges he will solidify his core strengths in the eyes of others
and most importantly himself .
2 ) you need for him to step up to the plate and fully support you by
insuring that he will "" take care of the
business , completely and totally . "" no hits to the p & l , zero tolerance for
incompetency and complacency .
you can not do what you need to do globally without the trust and confidence
in his performance
additionally he must identify and develop his successor .
get a covenant from brent that his is fully committed to do the work
also let him know you fully support him and will continue to back him fully
in this effort as long as he does his
part and keeps you informed .
call me if needed .

176,5811,update,"hello all ,
the program for the 2000 texas finance festival has been formalized and can
be found on our web site at
i do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on san antonio .
first , be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations .
at last count there were only 6 rooms left . second , i need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count .
i am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form .
remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on friday
so plan on arriving early friday or coming in on thursday evening if you
can . our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area ( the alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel ) .
we are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
friday and saturday evenings . the friday evening dinner begins at 6 p . m .
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
alamo at 8 : 00 p . m . for saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned .
there will be more information later as the conference nears . looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful , sunny san antonio .

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

pipeline to expand and not all of them feeding
the state . what have you all heard ?
ferc asks el paso to expand
a key ferc staffer this week asked el paso natural gas to consider switching
its line 2000 crude - oil conversion from a replacement project to an expansion
of its existing system to ease pipeline capacity constraints to the
california border .
"" i am writing to inquire about the feasibility of modifying the . . . project in
a manner which could assist the difficult situation now confronting the
california gas market , "" said daniel m . adamson , director of ferc ' s office of
energy projects .
in august , el paso filed an application to acquire an existing 30 - inch
diameter , 1 , 088 - mile crude oil pipeline from plains all american pipeline
l . p . , and convert part of it to natural gas transportation . the line extends
from mccamey , tx , to bakersfield , ca . el paso seeks to convert the 785 - mile
segment from mccamey to ehrenberg , az , to gas . el paso proposed the line 2000
project as a loop line to replace existing compression , and not as a system
expansion .
"" it appears that if el paso kept the six . . . compressor stations on the line
and implemented any necessary facility additions and modifications to
integrate the converted line with its existing south system , it may be
possible for el paso to increase its delivery capacity into california , ""
adamson said .
he asked el paso to consider this option , given "" the current difficult energy
situation there [ in california ] and the consequent need to examine all
possible options for substantive relief "" of the situation . "" i am interested
in your thoughts on this matter , including the feasibility of such an
expansion , the magnitude of facilities and costs which might be involved , who
would bear those costs , and possible procedural approaches . ""
if this "" is not a viable option , please indicate whether el paso is
considering other options for system expansion which would enhance gas
transmission capacity into california , "" adamson wrote .

hi niclas ,
i am in the middle of preparing some presentations right now , so it might be
more productive to speak by phone ( 503 - 464 - 8430 ) . please leave your number ,
if you get my voicemail .
to get you started , you might see if you can get access to the ferc gads
database of plant forced and planned availability . it seems others in
research have asked about this , so you may already have this at your
disposal . the eia has a good electronic database of plant for and por
available for free ( http : / / www . nerc . com / ~ esd / ) . i know alexios in re / ees has
this . if you wanted to do it the hard way , you can also ask jaison to access
the epa ' s cems data he has summarized on a machine there in research . it
contains hourly plant operation for every unit over about 50 mw , which you
could aggregate up .
the wscc 10 - year forecast of new plant construction and loads is a good place
to start for plant construction information , but suffers from some notorious
"" self - reporting "" error . it is available in pdf form from the web site
http : / / www . wscc . com / . other sources that should be more near - term , but more
accurate are the cec inventory of plants ( http : / / www . energy . ca . gov / ) and the
bpa whitebook ( http : / / www . transmission . bpa . gov ) .
as far as basic economic data is concerned , you can either rely on the
reported utility forecasts for loads , or you can go to fundamental data . the
ultimate source of the census data collected by the us dept of commerce ,
which you can buy on cdrom for cheap . it would have this kind of information
by sic code , by zip code . you may also have access to one of the economic
forecasting businesses ( wharton ' s wefa , dri , etc . ) they have this in highly
digested and complete form .
btw , tim heizenrader , who runs fundamental analysis and research on the west
desk , is a sharp cookie and should have all this under control . is your
client aware of this resource ?
give me a buzz and we can talk more ,

211,12744,fw : bistineau,"louise ,
this is the email written by paul bienawski regarding a potential aquisition of bistineau . you had mentioned an interest in seeing this email last week .
mrha

sent : thursday , august 23 , 2001 9 : 54 pm

cc : mrha , jean ; gregory , paul
subject : bistineau
importance : high
don ,
this is a long e - mail and i apologize for that but since we have not had a chance to talk , i wanted to send you some information on bistineau as well as the latest output from the storage group ' s m & a analysis .
the m & a analysis was just updated as they have been several reservoir transactions in the past few months ( aec @ manchester , atmos @ east diamond , and aquila @ lodi ) . prior to these transactions we did not have enough data points to draw meaningful conclusions about the trends in reservoir acquisition .
i have attached the output for your review but i think a couple of points are key .
the reservoir curve is "" hockey - sticking "" just as the salt curve did previously . while not as dramatic as salt , the premiums are increasing dramatically .
the market is not placing a premium on optionality . salt is inherently more flexible than a reservoir , yet on a deliverability basis , there does not appear to be a significant difference . that may explain why we see players who do value optionality in the marketplace ( aquila , aec , duke , etc ) . these companies have long established asset based storage groups and actively trade around these assets .
as far as bistineau is concerned , there are several points worth highlighting . i have attached output from the database maintained by the storage group for your reference . i have not included caverns but we do have that data .
reliant energy is part owner of the facility . reliant is aggressively trying to build a merchant storage business . my group has bumped into them several times in the marketplace .
since the facility is federally regulated , reliant and koch would be required to make a nga 7 ( b ) filing to abandon the services they provide their customers before anyone could purchase the reservoir . the length of this process would be a function of the number of intervenors .
bistineau is a very large reservoir with a large amount of native base gas . how much of this volume is recoverable ( and therefore monetizable ) is a large question mark .
relative to its peers , bistineau is a poor performer in terms of flexibility ( low injection capabilities )
koch has , in the past , written off losses at bistineau . the low injection rate may be as a result of this . i have not researched the exact amount of the losses but a seach of ferc filings would reveal the nature and extent of the losses . epps likewise has had some loss problems .
if enron ' s intent is to establish a storage asset position in louisiana , south downsville would probably be the best candidate . the field is privately held , under development , has many interconnects , and acquisition would probably meet little resistance given the lack of customers .
while i have not communicated with matrix in some time , i do know the principals and could easily get an update on their status and plans .
i will not be in tomorrow morning , but should you wish to discuss this e - mail , feel free to call me on my cell phone @ 713 - 825 - 2643 .",ham,2001-09-08

i talked with linda and michelle this week on this issue . what michelle
wanted to know was does tw have operators who have pnr agreements .
currently , tw does not have any operators with pnr agreements because they
have mandatory obas on tw . with our 637 compliance filing tw is requesting
that operators move their imbalance to a pnr if it is over a certin volume .
also eog does pool on tw so as a shipper we could get them to enter into a
pnr . they would need to have a shipper transport it to and from the pnr point .
i also told michelle that all points the flow any volumes on tw are required
to be an an oba .
michelle said that they were able to resolve this issue with eog .

mergers , takeovers , and acquisitions . dow jones ( dj , 37 . 00 ,
pe 32 ) , gannett ( gci , 79 . 00 , pe 16 ) , knight - ridder
( kri , 65 . 00 , pe 16 ) , and tribune co . ( trb , 40 . 00 , pe 24 )
are just a few examples of industry leaders that have spent
billions over the last few years acquiring aggressive and
profitable newspaper chains and publishing companies . cdyv
represents the epitome of an attractive buyout target as
their pe is 1 based on 12 - 18 month sales and earnings
figures . the industry average pe is 20 , indicating that a
share price of 5 . 00 for cdyv would be a very conservative
valuation .
it is only a matter of time before detailed information is
released out into the investment community . by receiving
this email , you are among the first public investors to
know about cdyv . get in now before the crowds take it to
the moon .

overview
global diversified industries operates in the modular
building construction industry , and strategically targets the
california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in
central california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot
state - of - the - art manufacturing facility .
throughout 2003 the company focused on building its
infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a
state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the
requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth .
through the combination of its new facility , the increased
demand for portable buildings and the state of california ' s
bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to become one
of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west
coast .
gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion school
improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california
voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion an
opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before
the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and
subsequently invests in those companies .
global diversified has taken numerous strategic development
steps throughout 2003 , including generating strong revenues as
well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in
2004 . the company is led by a strong management team with
previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per
annum businesses .
in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue
projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state
approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit
facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing
facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition
candidates through its aggressive growth plan .
profile
gdvi is a holding company that currently operates three
wholly owned subsidiaries , lutrex enterprises , inc . , an entity
which holds equipment and inventory for the registrant , mbs
construction inc . , a modular contractor specializing in
modular construction site work and renovation and global
modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and manufacturing of modular
type structures .
its principal customer base is currently educational
( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care
and municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a
variety of portable classroom designs , including both
single - story and two - story floor plans . global modular ' s
portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed
in accordance with pre - approved building plans , commonly
referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform
to structural and seismic safety specifications administered
by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .
global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing
educational customers with products contracted under a
piggyback clause . the state of california allows school
districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors
under a bidding process where the successful bidder can
provide other public school districts and municipalities
portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the
originating school district . this process saves school
districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of
soliciting bids .
a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract
containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options
may have access to future business for up to five years ,
depending on the term of the piggyback contract .
the strategic focus on california schools
since 1998 , california legislation has required that at
least 20 % of all new classrooms constructed with state funds
be portable structures .
there are five compelling reasons for this trend :
modular classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as
2 weeks )
they cost significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs .
$ 100 , 000 )
they offer greater flexibility for use compared to
conventional buildings
they are easier to finance
they provide financing incentives
to cope with population growth , the state department of
education estimates that california will need more than 2 , 500
classrooms each year for the next four years , which equates to
more than 10 , 000 classrooms .
due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the
california education sector , public and private schools are
expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill
their additional classroom requirements over the next four
years .
the california schools budget crisis
on november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities
improvements bond proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by
california voters .
this bond measure passage does not include an approximate
$ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various
school districts throughout the state .
a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion will go before
the voters on the march 2004 ballot , which is expected to
pass .
these bond measures are about three times higher than the
record $ 9 . 2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998 .
the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used
for school modernization programs , which include requirements
for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction
and renovations .
money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and
private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at
community colleges and other institutions of higher learning
throughout california .
gdvi business infrastructure
among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated ,
state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which
includes equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that
are specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of
modular structures .
gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking to
add to its workforce as demand increases .
operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square
foot operating structure .
wholly owned subsidiary ( lutrex enterprises ) owns the
equipment and assets involved in the manufacturing process
wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets ,
designs and manufactures the buildings
wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles
installation and building renovation .

subject : re : metals
andy ,
thanks so much for your message . i had you on my "" to do "" list today to
follow - up from our conversation last week . i appreciate your responses , and
will follow - up as needed .
just to recap eim ' s current inititives .
 ( pwc ) was engaged in 10 / 00 to develop a business plan
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical
business . in 11 / 00 , aa was engaged to develop a "" blueprint "" of eim major
processes ( deal execution , deal capture , risk management , logistics ,
settlements and financial reporting ) , down to level 2 processes . the
initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the
"" blueprint "" , a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and
recommended systems . a complete "" roadmap "" should be laid out with a
0 - 3 months , 4 - 6 months , 7 - 9 months and 10 - 12 months timeline . the plan
addresses tactical also .
our overall objective : build an infrastructure ( people , processes and
systems ) that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim . the
current industries are forest products and steel . however , additional
industries may be added . the targeted infrastructure would require little
change to support new industries .
the delieverable is expected by the end of 2 / 01 . we ' d be happy to visit with
you all ( video conference or houston , . . . . ) to give you more information . let
me know how to proceed .
thanks again for your time . since i wasn ' t able to attend the controllers '
conference last 10 / 00 , i ' m glad i got to meet you last week . stay in touch .

subject : metals
brenda
as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality
between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals .
in particular i promised info on a few areas :
project q assessment
a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals
( being to do with interfaces with our as 400 ysstem ) however high level issues
which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were :
q is over specified for metals . traffic / logistics for metals is less
complex than oil & coal .
metals process tends towards buy > store > sell whereas for liquids the storage
is not as prevelant
metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship / barge
2 . inventory controls
again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals . paul
wallace a manager in the co - ordination function is working extensively on
developing the controls in this area . i would suggest that you contact paul
directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in
general .
3 . funding of inventory
we have a structured finance facility here in london . the deal is specific to
enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are
the base index for all the positions placed in the facility . if structured
financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either
david tregar ( metals commercial ) or bill appleby ( global finance ) as an intro
to the issues faced .
4 . curve management process
the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme
curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and
location . given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by
brand group and port location . e . g . for copper this means we have a grid with
5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups ( 13 for europe , 7 for the us and 6
for the far east ) . the maintaince & price testing of the grids is made
manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port
groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points
i . e . price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a
market quote .
5 . re recruitment of paper traders
i haven ' t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david
rosenblum , one of the metals traders in chicago , is a trader of recylced
paper .
i ' ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london .
i ' d appreciate same for eim .

the new york times
page 24 , column 1
c . 2001 new york times company
earlier this year , most companies would have loved to have enron ' s problems . californians resented the energy trading company ' s huge profits during their energy crisis , and democrats in washington raised questions about enron ' s influence within the white house and about the cozy relationship between enron ' s chairman , kenneth lay , and vice president dick cheney . nobody seemed better positioned to thrive during the bush presidency than this houston - based apostle of deregulation .
wall street was impressed with enron ' s strategy of swooping into formerly regulated markets to broker contracts for natural gas , electricity or unused telecom bandwidth . the company was celebrated as a paragon of american ingenuity , a stodgy gas pipeline company that had reinvented itself as a high - tech clearinghouse in an ever - expanding roster of markets . enron ' s push to force utilities into the internet age with its online trading systems , at a seemingly handsome profit , became an epic tale of the dot - com revolution .
it now appears that enron ' s tale may be more cautionary than epic . enron envy has crashed , along with the company ' s stock price , as serious questions emerge about its bookkeeping . enron disclosed earlier this month that $ 1 . 2 billion in market value had vanished as a result of a controversial deal it entered into with private partnerships run by its chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
most alarming was enron ' s reluctance to shed light on management ' s wheeling and dealing . ' ' related - party transactions , ' ' as the accountants call them , are fraught with conflicts of interest . though much remains to be learned about these transactions , their scope and lack of transparency suggest that enron may have in effect created its own private hedge fund to assume some of the risk and mask the losses of its complex trading . the extent to which company insiders profited from the partnerships is not yet clear .
enron has scrambled to dampen wall street ' s concerns , acknowledging its credibility problem while insisting on the health of its core businesses . on wednesday it brought in william powers , the dean of the university of texas school of law , to review the transactions . the securities and exchange commission has launched its own formal investigation . mr . fastow was forced to resign , following jeffrey skilling , the man credited with driving enron into new cutting - edge businesses , out the door .
enron ' s former admirers on wall street , mindful of recent scandals involving high - profile companies doctoring their earnings , and of the spectacular collapse of the long - term capital management hedge fund in 1998 , are alarmed . carole coale of prudential securities summed up the prevailing sentiment when she told the times : ' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose facts . ' ' analysts , as well as the media , are not entirely blameless . enron did mention , albeit in passing , the troubling related - party deals as early as march 2000 . but few analysts bothered to raise questions at a time when the company ' s revenues , profits and stock price were soaring .
harvey pitt , the new securities and exchange commissioner , must pursue the enron inquiry aggressively in order to assure investors that he will be as vigilant as his predecessor , arthur levitt , when it comes to protecting the integrity of financial markets . indeed , even if enron is cleared of any wrongdoing and regains some of its past luster , as it well might , the company that preaches the merits of self - regulating marketplaces has reminded us all of the need for a strong regulator on wall street .

the enron debacle
byzantine deals have shattered the energy outfit ' s credibility
executives at high - flying enron corp . ( ene ) never seemed overly concerned with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices . earlier this year , the california attorney general had to get a court order to collect documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing . and when an analyst challenged former ceo jeffrey k . skilling in a conference call to produce enron ' s balance sheet , skilling called him an "" ass - - - - . "" still , even some enron executives worried that the company had gone too far with two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge investments . with enron ' s then - chief financial officer acting as general manager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their investments , the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from investors seemed overwhelming . "" internally , everybody said this is not a good idea , "" says a source close to the company .
but no one could have predicted such a jaw - dropping outcome for the nation ' s largest and most innovative energy trader . since oct . 16 , when enron revealed a $ 35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnerships and was forced to knock $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholders ' equity , the company ' s stock has plunged 60 % . the securities its highly ballyhooed business for trading high - speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom industry meltdown ; and its calamitous foray into the water business with azurix corp . has already cost enron at least $ 574 million in write - offs .
these bad bets and the expensive ljm shock have investors worried about what else might be lurking at enron . many aren ' t sticking around to find out . "" i think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the credibility of the management team , "" says richard a . giesen , who manages the munder power plus fund , which dumped its enron shares about a month ago .
it ' s not clear just how many off - balance - sheet financing vehicles enron has used over time . some were created years ago to finance oil and gas producers . analysts and sources close to the deals say there ' s no particular risk in these to enron shareholders . other interconnected entities , such as whitewing , osprey , atlantic water trust , and marlin water trust , were a way to get assets no longer central to enron ' s strategy off its balance sheet , freeing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broadband ( table ) .
to entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into these deals , enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren ' t enough to cover debt . such "" mandatory equity "" deals have been used by at least a half - dozen others in the energy and telecom industries , including el paso ( epg ) , williams , and dominion , says standard & poor ' s director todd a . shipman . "" nobody ' s going to find anything that ' s particularly unique or below board "" in such deals , says one investment banker specializing in the energy business .
worst case , which shipman considers unlikely , enron could be on the hook for about $ 3 billion in its mandatory - equity deals . that could mean diluting its shares by more than 25 % at today ' s prices . analyst john e . olson at sanders morris harris inc . ( smhg ) figures a 9 % dilution is more likely . even if this $ 3 billion in debt were included on enron ' s balance sheet now , the debt - to - capital ratio would climb to 54 % from about 49 % at the end of june . such a change would pressure enron ' s credit rating but not push it below investment grade , says shipman .
huge hit . fastow ' s ljm , a private equity fund , was a different kind of animal , according to sources familiar with the arrangements . it bought energy and other assets from enron , which booked gains and losses on those deals . ljm was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the volatility of some of enron ' s investments , including stakes in high - tech and telecom businesses and an interest in new power co . , which markets power to consumers . when enron terminated these deals in september , it took the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity .
but the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with the company . the first place that might show up is in enron ' s highly successful online platform , which trades everything from gas and electricity to weather derivatives . to reassure its partners , enron is scrambling to shore up its liquidity . it has already tapped $ 3 billion in credit lines and is trying to arrange another $ 1 billion . shipman says he has seen no signs of massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms . still , rival traders are wary . "" we certainly have taken a closer look at enron in the last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk , but we ' re still doing business with the company as usual , "" says keith g . stamm , ceo of power and gas trader aquila inc . ( ila )
"" speeding train . "" still , with the stock battered and rating agencies considering further downgrades , that could rapidly change . in recent days , the uncertainty about enron ' s future has reduced investors ' appetite for enron debt . "" no one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of survival , "" says a credit - derivatives salesperson . "" it ' s really difficult to get in front of a speeding train . ""
even if lay can calm his trading partners , he and his management team face a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on wall street . with the stock now hovering around $ 14 - - down from a high of $ 90 in august , 2000 - - some even believe that enron could be a takeover target for the likes of ge capital or royal dutch / shell group . ( rd ) both declined to comment . would enron sell ? one source close to the company says enron has talked about possible mergers and strategic alliances in the past with royal dutch / shell , among others . "" if they ' re really worried about liquidity , they might take the easy way out , "" he says .
if enron does pull through this crisis , some suspect it will be a humbler , more risk - averse place . the company that once believed it could expand its trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities - - from advertising space to steel - - will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions . that ' s something some investors applaud . "" the company should focus on its strengths , "" says william n . adams , senior energy analyst at banc of america capital management , a major shareholder . but that ' s a far less exciting place than enron ' s energy cowboys ever hoped to roam .

derivatives danger ?
lately , owners of enron ' s ( ene ) equity , bonds , and loans have been struggling to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they didn ' t know about before . now , as a fuller picture of enron ' s entanglements with partnerships begins to emerge , investors have something else to worry about : credit default swaps , known as cdss for short .
that ' s financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans . their owners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they have if their investments go bad . the cds market has existed only for about two years , but it ' s growing fast . goldman , sachs & co . ( gs ) and others estimate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $ 1 trillion and $ 1 . 5 trillion are covered . not surprisingly , big banks with hefty balance sheets such as j . p . morgan chase ( jpm ) , merrill lynch ( mer ) , and deutsche bank ( db ) dominate the market .
enron , however , is a player - - and the only significant one that isn ' t also a bank . competitors say that although enron has issued only between $ 500 million and $ 700 million worth of cdss so far this year , it had ambitious plans to offer them online . "" they don ' t belong in this market , "" says one trader . "" they don ' t understand the implications . "" enron did not return calls seeking comment .
of course , neither enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans and bonds they ' re insuring turn bad . trouble is , this year is potentially a doozie for losses on corporate debt . corporate defaults could reach a record of $ 100 billion , says standard & poor ' s , like businessweek a unit of the mcgraw - hill companies . regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $ 193 billion by early october .
if enron has insured any of the bad debt , it might have to take charges for losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting . with all that has been happening in recent weeks , that ' s the last thing it needs .

commentary : enron ' s clout won ' t sway the sec
for securities & exchange commission chairman harvey l . pitt , the sec ' s investigation into enron corp . ( ene ) could hardly have come at a worse time . the future of pitt ' s ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation could depend on how well he handles this case .
enron ' s political clout and close ties to president george w . bush create real risks for the sec . enron ceo kenneth l . lay is a longtime bush backer , and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the president ' s campaign . a bush appointee , pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act . he has made it clear he wants to speed up the sec ' s enforcement , in part by rewarding companies that cooperate with probes . but he insists the sec will still come down hard on true corporate miscreants - - and knows that any signs of let - up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda .
enter the enron probe . the fine shadings of securities enforcement - - where most cases are settled by negotiated penalties , not court - imposed fines - - often make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the sec is being tough or lenient . but pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the enron case is handled by the book - - getting the same strict scrutiny from the sec as any other , less connected company .
for now , top sec aides say that ' s happening . the sec enforcement div . in washington is looking into whether enron adequately disclosed to shareholders the risks of its complex deals with andrew s . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer . agency insiders say pitt and his fellow commissioners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds . but they insist pitt hasn ' t heard from the white house or enron ' s other political allies .
top lobbyist . enron ' s connections are numerous . besides lay ' s links to bush , an enron director , wendy lee gramm , is the wife of texas senator phil gramm , top republican on the senate banking committee . and enron spreads its lobbying budget - - $ 2 . 13 million in 2000 - - across both parties . just this year it hired four lobbying firms with democratic roots . enron says it lobbies heavily because it operates in regulated industries . it notes that electric utilities outspend it 35 to 1 .
on oct . 31 , a special committee of enron ' s board hired william r . mclucas , former sec enforcement director , to represent it . mclucas should know that any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire . pitt , who joined the sec out of law school in 1968 , "" remembers how the [ nixon - era ] sec tainted itself by turning a blind eye to [ fugitive financier ] robert vesco , "" says an agency veteran . pitt has too much riding on the enron probe to let its connections sway his judgment .

afl - cio , amalgamated bank call on enron to redirect the mission of newly created special committee : outside directors must adopt independent role
11 / 02 / 2001
pr newswire
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire )
washington , nov . 2 / prnewswire / - - in a shareholder letter sent today to the board of directors of the enron corporation ( nyse : ene ) , the afl - cio and the amalgamated bank called on enron to expand the mission of its newly created special committee and for enron ' s board to adopt a package of reforms designed to restore investor confidence in the battered energy firm . america ' s working families are significant shareholders of enron stock through their pension , health and welfare benefit funds .
among other suggestions , the letter urges the board to expand the special committee ' s mandate to : * examine all transactions with entities in which enron employees
or directors have an interest
* adopt procedures for reviewing insider participation in investments
* commence an extraordinary review of executive compensation
* adopt a stricter definition of director independence and disclose
director conflicts of interest
"" the special committee ' s mandate is far too narrow to address the current crisis , "" said richard trumka , secretary - treasurer of the afl - cio . "" in light of enron ' s recent balance sheet write - downs , share price decline , and credit rating deterioration , the special committee must be forward looking and consider sweeping governance reform measures , "" he explained .
"" in this time of crisis , outside directors must reform enron ' s traditional lack of transparency and communicate directly with shareholders , "" said gabriel caprio , president and ceo of the amalgamated bank . "" this is particularly important since several outside directors have apparent conflicts of interest that compromise their objectivity , "" he added .
afl - cio affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds with over $ 400 billion in assets and hold an estimated 3 . 1 million enron shares . the afl - cio is joined in its call for reform by the amalgamated bank , the trustee of the longview funds which hold 251 , 304 shares of enron . the amalgamated bank ' s longview funds are collective investment trusts that manage equity assets on behalf of workers ' benefit funds .

houston - ( dow jones ) - at the beginning of the year , two telecommunications units born of energy companies seemed to symbolize the different ways to sell bandwidth .
enron corp . ( ene ) was viewed as the hot pioneer blazing a trail for selling telecommunications network capacity as a commodity like natural gas or electricity .
on the other hand , williams communications group ( wcg ) seemed to promote the old - fashioned method that telecommunications companies have used for making long - term agreements .
on thursday , wcg reported third - quarter earnings of $ 22 . 6 million before taxes and interest . wcg chairman and chief executive howard janzen told dow jones newswires that the earnings validated williams ' model of a bandwidth company being a provider of services , not a trader of commodities .
"" i think bandwidth trading has its place , "" janzen said . "" it ' s developing relatively slowly . the reality is ( that ) bandwidth is not a commodity except for lower - capacity services and on certain routes with large amounts of capacity . ""
enron reported an $ 80 million third - quarter loss for its broadband services unit .
as janzen views it , bandwidth is defined by the technology used to provide it .
"" the bandwidth we ' ll sell five years from now will be different from what we ' re selling today because of changes in technology , "" he said .
after taxes and interest , williams reported a loss of $ 272 . 7 million on revenue of $ 297 . 8 million in the third quarter . an extraordinary gain of $ 223 . 7 million from the repurchase of senior redeemable notes in the open market enabled williams to post the positive result before taxes and interest .
in the same period a year ago , williams reported a net loss of $ 150 . 5 million on revenue of $ 209 million .
williams also announced thursday that it has agreed to buy the assets of coreexpress , a company which operated on williams ' network . coreexpress guarantees data delivery over multiple networks and developed software to monitor quality of service over multiple networks .
terms of the agreement weren ' t disclosed . the deal won ' t close until undisclosed conditions are met .
williams also announced a 20 - year agreement valued at $ 267 million to provide bandwidth to boeing co .

usa : enron shares plunge after s & p credit rating cut .
11 / 02 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 2 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . dropped more than 8 percent in early trade on friday , as the stock took a new plunge in a two - week free - fall , a day after its credit rating was cut for the second time this week .
enron was down 89 cents , or 7 . 4 percent , to $ 11 . 10 on the new york stock exchange , after briefly slipping to $ 10 . 95 , a price it also touched briefly on tuesday and last closed at in july 1992 .
enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , lined up $ 1 billion of new credit on thursday in a bid to restore investor confidence . even so , standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating after stock markets closed on thursday , saying it could do so again if the situation worsens .
enron has been rocked by a stock slide that has slashed two - thirds of its share price since oct . 16 , when the company reported a $ 1 billion charge that was caused , in part , by dealings linked to a chief financial officer who was subsequently ousted .
houston - based enron is facing an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission into those dealings . at issue are off - balance sheet deals with limited partnerships , run by then - cfo andrew fastow , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity .

goldman declines enron ' s request for loan amid credit concerns
2001 - 11 - 02 11 : 22 ( new york )
goldman declines enron ' s request for loan amid credit concerns
new york , nov . 2 ( bloomberg ) - - goldman sachs group inc .
refused to participate in a $ 1 billion loan to enron corp . because
it was unwilling to risk its capital on a client with falling
credit ratings that has been using its investment - banking services
less often , according to people familiar with matter .
enron chief executive kenneth lay asked for the line of
credit after meeting with bankers from goldman , j . p . morgan chase
& co . and citigroup inc . last month to discuss ways to alleviate a
cash crunch . j . p . morgan and citigroup agreed to lend on the
condition that the houston - based energy trader pledge two
pipelines as collateral .
goldman ' s refusal highlights its reluctance to provide credit
lines to all but its top fee - paying clients . by not lending to
enron , the firm also is able to advise companies that want to buy
enron or some of its assets , or make a bid of its own .
for enron , the decision makes it harder to resist the demands
of its existing lenders , who made the company give up collateral
and pay higher interest rates to get its new loan .
` ` people smell resistance to enron , ' ' said glenn reynolds , an
analyst with creditsights . com , an independent research firm . ` ` the
balance of power is the with the banks now . ' '
kathleen baum , a spokeswoman for goldman , said the firm had
` ` a long history of putting its capital to work for clients . ' ' she
wouldn ' t comment on the firm ' s relationship with enron . karen
denne , a spokeswoman for enron , said , ` ` i won ' t confirm who we
have had talks with . ' '
shut out
enron needed the $ 1 billion secured loan to supplement cash
reserves and help the company pay off existing debt . yesterday ,
standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s long - term credit rating to ` ` bbb , ' '
the second - lowest investment grade rating , from ` ` bbb + . ' '
the sec is investigating partnerships run by former chief
financial officer andrew fastow that bought and sold enron shares
and assets . those trades cost enron $ 35 million . the company also
lost $ 1 . 2 billion in shareholder equity .
enron ' s dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of
commercial - paper markets , where corporations borrow money for days
or weeks . lenders are concerned that the company may have further
losses from its trading business .
a week ago enron tapped $ 3 billion in credit lines , arranged
by j . p . morgan and citibank , to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial
paper it has outstanding .
already loaded down with enron debt , j . p . morgan and citibank
forced enron to pay as much as 2 . 5 percentage points more than the
london interbank offered rate , or libor , on its new loan ,
according to the people familiar with the matter . that ' s about
five times the spread enron is paying on its existing lines ,
according to bloomberg data .
the extra yield wasn ' t sufficient incentive for goldman to
lend . securities firms such as goldman are required to value
lending commitments at market prices , exposing them to potential
losses from declines in loan prices . banks such as j . p . morgan and
citibank are allowed to carry the assets at full value .
falling prices
enron ' s existing loans have already fallen to between 80 and
90 cents on the dollar since the company drew them down , according
to traders .
the company ' s 6 . 4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as
much as 6 cents on the dollar today , with price indications
between 68 and 73 cents , traders said . yesterday , traders bid for
the bonds at 74 cents and offered to sell them at 77 cents
goldman has been getting less investment - banking business
from enron .
the no . 3 u . s . securities firm by capital hasn ' t arranged a
bond sale for enron since 1995 , and enron hasn ' t picked goldman to
advise on an acquisition or sale since at least 1993 , according to
bloomberg data . the firm is a dealer on enron ' s $ 3 billion
commercial paper program and has arranged six of the company ' s 15
preferred share sales .
without a steady flow of investment banking fees , goldman is
reluctant to make loans that tie up capital in a business that is
less profitable than advising on mergers or underwriting
securities .
among clients the firm has turned down : ford motor co . , the
second - largest automaker , and vodafone group plc , europe ' s largest
cellular phone company .
goldman did extend $ 2 billion in credit to at & t corp . as part
of a $ 25 billion credit facility last year . the largest u . s . long -
distance phone company is one of the firm ' s most lucrative
clients , however , paying out more than $ 100 million in investment -
banking fees during the past five years .
after refusing to lend to enron , goldman is unlikely to
advise the energy trader on any of its planned $ 2 . 1 billion in
asset sales , the people familiar said .
j . p . morgan is advising enron on the sale of its azurix north
american water business and may be retained , along with
citigroup ' s salomon smith barney unit , to look at other disposals
and a possible sale of the whole company , the people said .
goldman , which has an energy trading business of its own , may
already be advising potential buyers of enron ' s businesses , or
lining up a bid of its own , reynolds said .
` ` we may well see goldman pop up on the other side , which
would explain its reticence to lend , ' ' he said .
power points : time for a bronx miracle in houston

a dow jones newswires column
new york - ( dow jones ) - with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by two runs with one man on , enron corp . ( ene ) needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game .
this is the home run enron must come up with : full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet , and proof the corporation can cover the difference . it ' s what stockholders , bondholders and trading partners have been demanding , but time is running out , and enron hasn ' t produced .
"" we ' re going to get to that number soon and tell people . we have to do that , "" said a source at enron , who didn ' t know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited . "" in this environment , we are going to be absolutely sure that it ' s accurate . ""
enron has about $ 3 . 3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in 2003 . the company will sell the assets in those partnerships and , in a worse case scenario , will face a $ 1 billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets , enron has said . the company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock , shares will be trading closer to $ 20 than their current $ 11 .
investors , however , aren ' t acting as if they ' re reassured . part of the trouble , analysts with credit - rating firm standard & poor ' s said friday morning , is that until enron sells the assets , nobody knows for sure what they ' re worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole .
s & p is confident that enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole , provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company .
credit derivative fizzle
to see the pickle the world ' s premier energy franchise is in , one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk . that relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely , but the desk hasn ' t been able to transact for three weeks , since the value of enron ' s stock and bonds began to plummet , according to another enron employee .
enron didn ' t respond to a request for comment , but the enron credit division in europe said in a release that lines are "" constrained "" as the market continues to evaluate the company ' s credit position .
until recently , customers would buy a credit derivative from enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company . a big supplier to a financially troubled company like xerox corp . ( xrx ) or lucent technologies ( lu ) , for example , might pay enron $ 1 million a year for a payout of , say , $ 10 million in the event of a bankruptcy .
but you wouldn ' t pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims . likewise , with enron ' s creditworthiness in doubt , there ' s no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange lucent risk for enron risk .
the same holds true , though less obviously , for enron ' s core business of energy trading . some utilities , large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - already on the rise at $ 3 per million british thermal units - shoot to $ 10 this winter as they did last winter .
to guard against that risk , companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices . if a company wants to lock in winter gas at $ 3 , should it turn to enron ? if gas were to rise to $ 10 in january and enron couldn ' t deliver , enron ' s counterparty paid a good price for no protection . and if enron failed in a $ 10 gas market , that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies . gas could go to $ 20 in a heartbeat .
leading role an asset
enron does have a man on base . the company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want enron to survive . and any company that moves to lock enron out of the market now could regret doing so if enron survives as the big dog .
enron ' s trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point : they are continuing to trade with enron , but are avoiding long - term deals that increase their exposure to the company . the only acceptable long - term deals are those that offset deals done earlier . unless and until a bill goes unpaid , they ' ll keep delivering .
enron , like the rest of the u . s . energy industry , paid its bills for september gas deliveries on oct . 20 and for its september electricity deliveries on oct . 25 . its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of november .
that means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before enron ' s creditworthiness faces another test . in exchange for taking on that small risk , they keep the great market maker in business .
lenders show concerns
lenders , whether through holding enron bonds or providing loans , don ' t have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash . lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time , usually years .
outside of long - term commitments , what worries the banks , which presumably got a good look at enron ' s books ? if enron is now unable to make the big bets with long - term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years , can it service all of its liabilities , known and unknown ? if it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants , or otherwise put those assets at risk , will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs ? what happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsewhere ?
if enron is to have a chance , it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt . so far this year , trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for $ 2 . 2 billion out of $ 2 . 4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes . by comparison , enron has made $ 617 million in interest payments so far this year .

enron says it remains ' biggest ' player in eu gas , power

london - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ( ene ) said in a statement friday that it remains the "" the biggest buyer and seller of gas and power in europe , "" and that its enrononline platform "" continues to be the key trading platform in europe . ""
the company issued the statement in response to widespread rumors that several companies have ceased trading gas and power with enron since its share price took a nosedive last week .
in the statement , enron added that worldwide transactions in the power and gas markets were averaging $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion a day , up from a 30 - day average of $ 2 . 5 billion at close of business friday , oct . 26 .
enron has been on the defensive after announcing a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million two weeks ago , followed by news that it took a $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down , based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers .
on wednesday , enron disclosed that the sec elevated its inquiry into enron ' s alleged related - party transactions to a formal probe .
enron corp . secured $ 1 billion in new credit lines this week , but the deal did not appease credit - rating agency standard + 44 - ( 0 ) 20 - 7842 - 9345 ; sarah . spikes @ dowjones . com

usa : update 1 - enron shares fall as investor concerns linger .
by janet mcgurty
11 / 02 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 2 ( reuters ) - shares in enron corp . , the u . s . energy trading giant facing a federal probe into its dealings , declined on friday amid lingering investor concern about management credibility and the outcome of pending lawsuits .
shares of enron were off 62 cents , or 5 . 2 percent , at $ 11 . 37 in early afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , recouping some losses after plunging briefly to $ 10 . 95 , a closing price last seen in july 1992 and touched in intraday trade on tuesday .
enron debt due in 2006 declined about another 6 points , and was trading at about 65 cents on the dollar . the bonds were trading at about $ 1 . 01 two weeks ago , before enron announced on oct . 16 a $ 1 billion charge , caused in part by dealings linked to partnerships run until recently by a chief financial officer who was ousted last week , and that form part of the federal probe .
"" there remain several fundamental issues that we believe need to be addressed before the clouds can clear above enron ' s skies , "" said ronald barone of brokerage ubs warburg .
apart from the probe by the securities and exchange commission , barone said concerns include "" the evolving state of the company ' s balance sheet , management credibility and ultimate outcome of shareholder lawsuits . ""
a handful of law firms have sued enron , saying it overstated operating results , failed to write down assets on a timely basis and concealed investments that might require the company to issue large amounts of shares to cover loses .
enron ' s woes have put it under intense investor scrutiny , with the company losing about $ 17 billion in market capitalization in the past two weeks . the afl - cio union umbrella urged enron on friday to review executive compensation and adopt procedures for insider investments , among other recommendations .
afl - cio affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds that hold an estimated 3 . 1 million enron shares .
premium player in risk management
shares also plunged on friday - they have fallen about two - thirds in the past two weeks - after standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating late thursday , the second cut this week .
although s & p said another rate cut could ensue if enron ' s situation worsens , a team of s & p analysts told investors on a conference call on friday they were confident they were aware of all the company ' s financial obligations .
enron has been criticized for providing scant details about its dealings , leading to concerns about the riskiness of its obligations .
"" enron is a premium player in the risk management area , "" said ronald barone , a member of the s & p team who is not related to ubs ' s barone .
the s & p analysts said they were using about $ 1 . 5 billion as the amount of off - balance sheet items , about half the $ 3 billion calculated in past years , because of a change in reporting international energy assets , which no longer puts non - recourse debt onto the balance sheet in places like india and south america .
the s & p analysts also said they felt enron ' s move to secure a $ 1 billion line of additional credit earlier this week sent out enron ' s clear commitment to credit quality .
they also said it seemed reasonable to expect a long - term solution to fix enron ' s hard to understand balance sheet would assume an infusion of long - term equity as well as asset sales .
the s & p ratings team also said it was closely monitoring enron ' s trading partners for a change in their credit stance toward enron and , to date , have seen no significant change .
but they cautioned that could change at any time and that was the reason for putting enron on the credit watch listing .
enron chairman and chief executive officer ken lay , who has been criticized for not providing the public enough details on enron , was a no - show at a business conference in houston where he had been scheduled to speak on friday morning .
enron executive robert bradley , who declined to respond to questions from reuters after his speech , said he had been sent to replace lay because "" ken is better at putting out fires at enron . ""

i know that tim jones is from mg , so he will be found in the ect europe
external address book . in order to address him , i create a reply or new
message and then click on the address button . change the address book from
ect or enron to the ect external address book :
at this point i need to skip down to the jones ' in the list , so i just type

cera alert : december 13 , 2000
title : california on the brink
cera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas
california on the brink
the california stalemate
california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over
credit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would
avoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california ' s utilities , the
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address
the situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .
western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this
summer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis ,
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and
significant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied
the requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end
their rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance
the costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .
the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to
address the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective
solution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain
muddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is
possible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail
to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .
in the six months since california ' s supply shortfall began plaguing western
markets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .
rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and
demand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed ,
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by
discouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated
changes to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a
challenging siting and permitting process .
medicine worse than the illness
several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of
california ' s electric market woes . *
* challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power
plant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone
has struck down some key proposed facilities .
* price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices
limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .
* repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including
the price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new
plant development .
* calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the
ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the
california markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of
gaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits
are a threat to new plant development .
* facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .
cera ' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west
are not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of
older units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .
california ' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers
considering entering the state .
despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in
the state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .
in addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the
earliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk
of an outage .
the road to recovery
there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity
shortfall :
* encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal
some have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these
actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?
* stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new
build .
* move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the
pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence
( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in
the state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with
the market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move
toward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a
series of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if
they end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect
of knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments .
* encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although
originally a feature of california ' s market design , most consumers are
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a
demand response .
* encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "" boom bust "" characteristic of
the market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement ,
or a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to
elicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate )
future price volatility .
* avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to
be restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term
contractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the
market structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since
july - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to
do its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its
course .
* allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to
emissions restrictions .
* free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa
power plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from
operating to generate only power .
* * end * *

enron corp . , scrambling to restore confidence in its finances , is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion , and is likely to close a deal within days , according to officials familiar with the matter .
the new credit line is intended to bolster enron ' s financial condition and head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence . the new credit would supplement existing lines , which are largely tapped out after enron last week drew down about $ 3 billion to increase cash reserves and calm fears in the stock , bond and energy markets .
an enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line , but said he couldn ' t supply any further details .
houston - based enron is the nation ' s biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . once a favorite of wall street , the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that , despite difficulties , its finances remain sound .
confidence in enron ' s financial situation was shaken after enron earlier this month announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then - chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
last week , enron replaced mr . fastow and said that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions . the company has consistently said that the transactions were proper and legal .
enron ' s stock price fell again friday . as of 4 p . m . , in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down 95 cents at $ 15 . 40 . enron shares have fallen 50 % in the past two weeks and are down 83 % from a sept . 18 , 2000 , high of $ 89 . 63 .
late last week , enron tapped its existing credit lines , with part of that money being used to redeem nearly $ 2 billion of its outstanding commercial paper , or short - term corporate ious . ron barone of credit - rating agency standard & poor ' s said he believes that enron was "" getting a bit more resistance "" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due . thus , enron probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstanding , he said .
the enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly $ 1 billion cash on hand would give it more financial flexibility .
also last week , credit - rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing enron ' s debt and commercial - paper ratings for a possible downgrade . a lower rating could hamper enron ' s core trading businesses .
behind the worries among these agencies , in part , is the loss of investor confidence , which one of the rating companies , fitch , said in a report last week could impair "" enron ' s financial flexibility and access to capital markets , therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business . ""
the enron spokesman said yesterday that the company ' s trading partners are doing business with enron on "" essentially the same terms "" as they have in the past . "" there has been no significant change in the credit conditions , "" he said . trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant ' s finances .
the banks involved in the current negotiations , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , are asking enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past , one official said .
bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that enron can meet its commitments . "" confidence in this company was lost , "" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line . "" but confidence will be restored . ""
corporations of enron ' s size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency , they have access to cash . in practice , few companies actually make use of these lines . thus , drawing down credit lines , while providing immediate cash , also illustrates the pressure enron is feeling .

manager ' s journal : how enron ran out of gas
by paul kedrosky

is troubled enron corp . the long term capital management of the energy markets , or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases ? or is poor enron just misunderstood ? those are the questions after another week of chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered houston - based energy concern .
a year ago enron was the hottest of the hot . while tech stocks were tanking , enron ' s shares gained 89 % during 2000 . even die - hard enron skeptics - - of which there are many - - had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company . earnings were up 25 % , and revenues more than doubled .
not bad , considering where the company came from . a decade ago 80 % of enron ' s revenues came from the staid ( and regulated ) gas - pipeline business . no longer . enron has been selling those assets steadily , partly fuelling revenues , but also expanding into new areas . by 2000 , around 95 % of its revenues and more than 80 % of its profits came from trading energy , and buying and selling stakes in energy producers .
the stock market applauded the move : at its peak , enron was trading at around 55 times earnings . that ' s more like cisco ' s once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2 . 5 times earnings the market affords enron competitor duke energy .
but enron management wanted more . it was , after all , a "" new economy "" web - based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded . according to enron chairman and ceo ken lay , the company deserved to be valued accordingly . at a conference early this year he told investors the company ' s stock should be trading much higher - - say $ 126 , more than double its price then .
then the new economy motor stalled . the company ' s president left under strange circumstances . and rumors swirled about enron ' s machinations in california ' s energy markets . investors pored over enron ' s weakening financial statements . but enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of talmudic scholars to penetrate the company ' s cryptic financials . in effect , enron ' s troubles were hiding in plain sight .
it should have been a warning . because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company , or how it was trying to make its numbers . most analysts blithely concede that they really didn ' t know how enron made money - - in good markets or bad .
not that enron didn ' t make money , it did - - albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required - - but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off - balance sheet transactions , sometimes from energy - trading revenues . and it was very difficult to understand why or how - - or how likely it was enron could do it again next quarter .
enron ' s financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff . deep inside the company filings was mention of ljm cayman , l . p . , a private investment partnership . according to enron ' s march 2000 10 - k , a "" senior officer of enron is the managing member "" of ljm . well , that was a puzzler . ljm was helping enron "" manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives , including swaps , puts , and collars . "" it was , in a phrase , enron ' s house hedge fund .
there is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market - - it is crucial for a market - maker . but having an enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether , especially when the enron executive was the company ' s cfo , andrew fastow . while he severed his connection with ljm ( and related partnerships ) in july of this year - - and left enron in a whirl of confusion last week - - the damage had been done .
as stories in this paper have since made clear , mr . fastow ' s ljm partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict - ridden , board - approved ljm - enron relationship . and recently enron ended the merry affair , taking a billion - dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of ljm ' s wrong - footed hedging . analysts , investors , and the securities & exchange commission were left with many questions , and very few answers .
to be fair , i suppose , enron did disclose the ljm arrangement more than a year ago , saying it had erected a chinese wall between fastow / ljm and the company . and in a bull market , no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was - - or questioned the strength of the wall . now it matters , as do other enron - hedged financings , a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003 .
we didn ' t do anything wrong is mr . lay ' s refrain in the company ' s current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls . that remains to be seen , but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment , and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency .
where has enron ' s board of directors been through all of this ? what kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics , government sorts , and retired executives exercised for enron shareholders ? very little , it seems . it is time enron ' s board did a proper investigation , and then cleaned house - - perhaps neatly finishing with themselves .

enron seeks additional financing

c . 2001 new york times company
dallas , oct . 28 - - the enron corporation , still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer , is seeking $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in additional financing from banks , an industry official said today .
last week , enron , the nation ' s largest energy - trading concern , used about $ 3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $ 2 billion to pay off commercial paper . now , by obtaining even more financing , enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy - trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it .
enron ' s board , which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company ' s financial situation , held another meeting this afternoon . ' ' the board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate , ' ' an enron spokesman said .
two weeks ago , enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . the company also disclosed about $ 1 billion in separate write - offs , and it said last week that the securities and exchange commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting .
enron hopes to maintain its investment - grade credit rating , which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it . lately , enron ' s bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds , and two major credit - rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company ' s rating .

enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week , doing severe damage to mutual funds , the company ' s largest institutional ownership bloc , and the havoc may continue .
more than 15 per cent of the 4 , 000 us equity funds held shares in the embattled company ' s shares as of the most recent reporting period , according to fund tracker morningstar .
mutual funds held a fifth of enron ' s shares , but that percentage is likely to be much lower now , say fund analysts , who suggest much of the stock ' s halving in october is due to large sales by institutional holders .
janus , the growth fund specialist , was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings , dated june 30 , with more than 42 m shares representing a stake worth dollars 2 . 1 bn .
the stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth dollars 659 m at friday ' s closing price of dollars 15 . 40 . enron shares dropped 95 cents , or 5 . 81 per cent on friday , taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . on friday , several leading rating agencies put the company ' s debt on credit watches , and enron bond prices plunged . the company ' s stock is down 81 per cent since january .
most fund managers , including those at janus , refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading . however , several mutual fund groups with large enron stakes have said their listed positions are "" dated "" , implying that the funds ' positions in the company have changed .
morningstar analyst christine benz , who follows the janus funds , said managers of the group ' s larger funds had been "" lightening up "" their enron holdings this year . she said blaine rollins , who manages the dollars 23 bn flagship janus fund , said that in september he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2 . 15 per cent of outstanding shares as of april 30 - but did not say when .
ken zschappel , manager of the dollars 11 bn aim constellation fund , also declined to discuss his holdings , listed as 0 . 27 per cent of outstanding shares as of march 31 . but aim said the position had since been "" trimmed substantially "" .
other top fund owners , as of the most recent filings , included the alliance premier growth fund , the janus twenty , janus mercury and janus growth & income funds , fidelity magellan , axp new dimensions fund , putnam investors , putnam voyager and putnam new opportunities funds and morgan stanley dividend growth fund .

comment & analysis - enron flickers .

comment & analysis - enron flickers - once a paragon of the new economy , the us energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free - wheeling management , write simon london and sheila mcnulty .
enron has some explaining to do . for the past decade or more , the texas - based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast - growing energy trader . now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind .
its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year . the us securities and exchange commission is investigating multi - million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer , which resulted in a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity . a hastily - convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these "" related - party transactions "" . the departure of andy fastow , the aforementioned cfo , soon followed .
with its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies , enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines . yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity .
"" this marks the end of enron ' s walk on the wild side , "" observes curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , the investment bank .
on the surface , events at enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions , a complex capital structure and poor investor relations . but the root causes go back further . the entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled enron ' s growth in the 1990 s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis . therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "" new economy "" magic on to old economy companies .
enron ' s transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of jeffrey skilling , who was hired from mckinsey , the management consulting firm , to develop energy trading .
for the previous decade enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating us energy markets under the guidance of kenneth lay , a former deputy under - secretary of energy . mr lay remains chairman . but it was mr skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it .
the two sides of the business - trading and generation / supply - have always been strange bedfellows . the former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on wall street than in a utility . mr skilling ' s answer in the early 1990 s was to bring in talent from outside the company . one of his first recruits was mr fastow , an expert in securitisation , the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets .
the energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself . a management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice - president , director , manager and associate / analyst - much like a consulting firm . employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked , so long as they delivered results . as one of mr skilling ' s early recruits recalled : "" it was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules . ""
the seemingly free - wheeling style was based on a "" loose - tight "" management model expounded by tom peters and bob waterman , the management writers and mckinsey alumni . at enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets .
up - and - coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory . louise kitchen , the 32 - year - old british executive who was the creative force behind enron online , the group ' s internet - based trading platform , changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years .
balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk , legal commitments , finance and performance evaluation / remuneration . mr skilling once described the approach in this way : "" as long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens , you can do whatever you want around here . ""
this approach did deliver growth and innovation . as well as making markets in its core energy products , enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals . the success of enron online allows the group to describe itself as the world ' s leading e - commerce company .
it has also started marketing electricity to us consumers through a joint venture with international business machines and america online , the internet service provider .
in february this year mr skilling got his reward : he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in fortune magazine ' s list of the 500 most powerful us corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as ibm , at & t , bank of america and boeing .
in retrospect , however , this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price . first was the personal cost to mr skilling . in august he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job . personal , non - health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation .
a second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity . in order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded , enron used a range of off - balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion . ljm , the private equity fund in which mr fastow played a role , is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to enron ' s accounts . other financing vehicles include osprey , marlin , whitewing , atlantic water trust and azurix . "" they went after too many things too quickly , "" says stephen moore of moody ' s investors service , the credit ratings agency .
a third cost , associated with the last , was a loss of financial transparency . the group ' s extensive use of swaps , options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed .
david fleischer , an analyst at goldman sachs , summed up the views of many investors during last week ' s conference call . he told the group ' s management : "" the company ' s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure . there is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable . ""
the fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus . "" the problems , in our view , stem from enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills , "" argues raymond niles , analyst at salomon smith barney . "" power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market , and using a fibre - optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated , or only tangentially related , to their core merchant energy business . ""
enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures . this time last year mr skilling was arguing that enron broadband was a business worth $ 35 bn ( # 24 bn ) in its own right . this helped push the share price to all - time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise .
"" they over - promised on the new business they created , "" says chris bartlett , a professor at harvard business school and long - time watcher of the company . "" enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with enron online and the broadband business . to some extent they are now paying the price . ""
will enron weather the storm ? notwithstanding the risk of further out - of - the - blue financial shocks , most analysts believe that it will . the merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable . mr niles at salomon smith barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30 - 40 per cent annual growth over the past three years . assets totalling more than $ 4 bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted , underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group ' s portfolio of physical energy assets .
and yet the doubts remain . it is , ultimately , a question of confidence and credibility . investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former . mr lay and his team will have to tighten up .

( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved
enron , the troubled us energy group , was attempting yesterday to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fall in its share price .
the houston - based company was also due last night to hold a special board meeting to consider confidence - building measures after surprise financial disclosures damaged its reputation among us investors .
last week the company raised $ 3 . 3 bn ( euros 3 . 7 bn ) in cash to bolster its financial position but enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for additional finance . the company insisted , however , that it was in good financial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong .
mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said he hoped the company would have something to announce in coming days from its latest effort to "" establish additional lines of liquidity "" . "" once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up , that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest , "" mr palmer said .
the company ' s problems have become public since an announcement on october 16 that it would take a $ 1 . 01 bn special charge and write down shareholders ' equity by another $ 1 . 2 bn . the moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , who was forced to take a leave of absence last week .
enron ' s share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the october 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically "" junk "" status , though its official ratings are still investment grade .
"" our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations , "" said raymond niles of salomon smith barney . "" these activities require at least an investment grade credit rating , or enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirements . ""
the controversy over enron ' s balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a request for information from the securities and exchange commission . enron flickers , page 22 .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 26 ( reuters ) - last year , enron corp . was a darling of investors and analysts , but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural gas now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its business dealings .
enron , trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its credit worthiness and their unease over the company ' s complex financial transactions , has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the past week .
but the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the united states is not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the market volatility that drove earnings last year eases .
while enron ' s problems differ from more traditional utilities , many other power producers are returning to their roots . they are scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy .
paul patterson , an energy analyst with abn amro , said there are common themes affecting the industry .
"" one is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them . and two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth , "" patterson said .
as earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward , some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment . and plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off .
shares of enron slid $ 1 . 05 , or 6 . 4 percent , to $ 15 . 30 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange on friday .
the world has changed
aes corp . , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in brazil and britain , said thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets .
"" it ' s a different place , "" aes ' chief executive officer dennis bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year ' s powerful growth . on friday , constellation energy group , parent company of baltimore gas & electric , scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes . constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with goldman sachs , which planned to make an equity investment in the company .
"" the utility industry and energy markets , and indeed the entire u . s . economy , have changed considerably in the past year . as a combined company , we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver , "" said christian poindexter , constellation ' s chairman .
return to traditional values
bakke said one prong of aes ' s brave , new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable , long - term contract generation business .
it makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long - term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth , according to gordon howald , energy analyst with credit lyonnaise .
"" calpine does it already , "" he said , referring to the california - based independent power producer that has the lion ' s share of the power it generates contracted out . "" what drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient . physical reserve margins were low . but with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level , "" he added .
howald said with all the new generation coming on , natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further , squeezing spark spreads , or profit margins , for solely gas fired companies .
smaller companies also rethink strategies
as lower power prices impact earnings , many power companies are turning back to u . s . markets to try to maximize their bottom line .
"" earnings for the quarter is not the big deal . the big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected . it ' s a downward revision of earnings guidance . "" said patterson .
michigan - based cms energy corp . cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $ 2 to $ 2 . 05 for 2002 , down from $ 2 . 79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in north america .
cms , whose earnings were down for the third quarter , said it took a charge for planned divestitures , south american energy distribution units as well as other international investments .
allegheny energy inc . also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings .
the maryland - based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets , it will not proceed with the offering at this time .
"" the company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstrated value can and will be created for shareholders , "" allegheny said .

new york ( afx ) - enron corp is negotiating with banks for a new credit line , a spokesman told the wall street journal .
the company is in talks to raise between 1 - 2 bln usd and is likely to close a deal within days , it quoted officials familiar with the matter as saying .
the deal , which is intended to head off a potential loss of investor and business confidence , would supplement existing lines . these are largely tapped out after enron last week drew down about 3 bln usd to increase cash reserves and calm market fears .
enron earlier this month announced a heavy third quarter loss and erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then chief financial officer , andrew fastow .

japan is in the process of deregulating its power market . since march last year , large - lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers .
in its polyester business , teijin has expanded overseas output while reducing domestic production , a trend which would leave it with surplus power . it is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus .
the two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of teijin ' s existing power generator in matsuyama , teijin said . it hopes to reduce costs at the inefficient small plant with the help of enron .
enron corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) fired power plant in northern japan , aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a power plant in japan .
the teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility study by june 2002 .
teijin ' s shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2 . 68 percent at 472 yen .

is time running out for enron ?
at the beginning of this year , the enron corporation , the world ' s dominant energy trader , appeared unstoppable . the company ' s decade - long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from california to new york . its ties to the bush administration assured that its views would be heard in washington . its sales , profits and stock were soaring .
and under the leadership of jeffrey k . skilling , its chief executive , enron ' s arrogance had grown even more quickly .
the company , based in houston , dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets - - for electricity , water and everything else . everyone would win under deregulation , enron said - - especially its shareholders , whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets .
' ' we are on the side of angels , ' ' mr . skilling said in march , dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in california ' s energy crisis . ' ' people want to have open , competitive markets . they want fair competition . it ' s the american way . ' '
but less than a year later , everybody seems to have lost , especially enron ' s investors . enron ' s stock is plunging , and questions about its finances are mounting .
some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens , trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile . in a worst - case outlook , enron could become the 2001 version of long - term capital management , the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998 . enron ' s shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year , erasing $ 50 billion in shareholder value .
enron closed on friday at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents , after hitting a 52 - week low of $ 15 . 04 earlier in the day .
the future of electricity deregulation is in doubt , thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in california earlier this year - - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation ' s basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market . enron ' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , mr . skilling quit , forcing kenneth l . lay , his predecessor as chief executive and still enron ' s chairman , to resume day - to - day control of the company .
the company declined to make senior executives , including mr . lay , available for comment , and asked that questions be submitted in writing . mr . skilling could not be reached .
enron ' s problems boiled over earlier this month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in enron ' s regular financial statements . the securities and exchange commission is looking into the company ' s financial reporting , and some investors question whether enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas .
the slump in the company ' s shares accelerated after enron revealed the fall in its shareholders ' equity . on wednesday , the company forced out its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who is at the center of the controversy over enron ' s confusing finances . the company , which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from california ' s energy crisis , today faces a potential cash crunch .
the surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors ' smoldering concern about enron ' s opaque financial statements . now , with wall street analysts and bond - rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company ' s profits , enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash .
enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash . on thursday , the company drew down a $ 3 . 3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , which have each extended at least $ 400 million . but because of enron ' s importance in the natural gas and electricity markets , industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide .
the supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed , because enron is mainly a trader , rather than a producer , of energy . but a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices , which have swung wildly in the last year .
philip k . verleger jr . , an energy - markets economist , emphasized that he thought enron would survive this crisis . but he said it was not clear what would happen if enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company ' s enrononline internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations .
' ' you suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - - are they good ? are the firm ' s hedges good ? what ' s the situation ? ' ' mr . verleger said . ' ' it ' s got everyone scared . ' '
in the short run , enron ' s credit rating may be its biggest problem . if the company ' s rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed . but creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable , because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company .
a drop in the company ' s credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with enron , hurting the company ' s sales and profits .
enron ' s credit rating stands several notches above the critical point . but its bonds , which are publicly traded , have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent , comparable with many junk bonds . two of the three major credit - rating agencies , moody ' s investors service and fitch investors service , have put enron ' s bonds on review for possible downgrades .
' ' the issue that ' s in the front of everybody ' s mind right now is credit , ' ' said mark gurley , senior vice president and general manager for trading at aquila inc . , one of the nation ' s largest energy traders . aquila is based in kansas city , mo .
for now , aquila and other major energy traders and producers , including reliant energy , the el paso corporation and dynegy , are continuing to do business with enron . and mr . gurley said that enron ' s own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of long - term capital management in 1998 .
' ' they haven ' t done anything trading - wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down , ' ' he said .
still , some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with enron , especially long - term contracts . they also said risk - management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation .
mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said on friday that no energy - trading company had stopped doing business with enron . he declined to say whether any of the company ' s trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms . he said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business .
but the crisis that enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront . for years , the details of enron ' s finances have been a mystery even to the wall street analysts whose job it is to follow the company , and to the investors who own its stock and bonds . when enron ' s profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets , shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements .
now they do . yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask .
to others in the industry , the opaqueness of the company ' s financial statements parallels enron ' s efforts to keep its energy - trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements . though they do not expect enron to crumble like long - term capital management , they say that , like the giant hedge fund , enron uses a lot of debt , regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances .
the most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet . with names like marlin and osprey , the partnerships have at least $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds outstanding , backed by assets like a stake in azurix , enron ' s water company subsidiary . enron has promised that if the partnerships ' debts exceed the value of their assets , enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference .
deals with partnerships formed by mr . fastow , who was chief financial officer when they were organized , led to the $ 1 . 2 billion write - off in shareholders ' equity that enron announced last week . the company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships .
enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter , after being criticized by shareholders . in the process , it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books , reducing its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . but , because of complex accounting rules , the transaction was not apparent in enron ' s quarterly earnings report .
the transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that enron may have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . when enron released third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 , it reported a loss from $ 1 billion in write - offs on failed investments . the earnings statement did not mention the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down . but the company said its core business had been solidly profitable , and its shares rose .
in a conference call with analysts after the announcement , mr . lay , enron ' s chairman , also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity . the reference was a brief one , however , and some listeners did not catch it . those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what enron had done , and many were confused by the accounting procedure . enron ' s stock began to slide , and investors clamored for more information about the write - off . but so far , the company ' s efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors .
mr . lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals , but some on wall street say they have come away with doubts about mr . lay ' s grasp of the situation . they say that the two people at enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - - mr . skilling and mr . fastow - - have both left the company .
in an interview in late august , mr . lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving mr . fastow . in response to one question about them , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' '
mr . palmer of enron disputed any suggestion that mr . lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue , saying mr . lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the s . e . c . investigation . ' ' there is not a whole lot we can say , or should say , about them , ' ' mr . palmer said . he also said the company expected to generate about $ 3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year .
in a conference call on tuesday , analysts pressed mr . lay and other top enron executives to reveal more information about the ljm write - down and its other partnerships . instead , they offered only vague explanations of the deal , leaving wall street worried that more write - offs might be coming .
david fleischer , a goldman , sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company , was among those who came away concerned . ' ' if enron is unable to clarify its off - balance - sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position , then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets , ' ' he wrote in a research note after the call .
to try to reassure investors , enron said late thursday that enrononline , its internet - based trading exchange , executed more than 8 , 400 trades that day , a higher - than - normal volume .
' ' we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - - and we ' re working on that , ' ' mr . lay said in a statement . ' ' but in the meantime , the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to enron . ' '
but those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for wall street . enron ' s stock tumbled almost 6 percent friday , to its lowest levels in six years .
now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of enron ' s off - balance - sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees .
carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , calculates that enron may have close to $ 9 billion in off - balance - sheet debt . she said that enron had for two years been trying to sell about $ 6 billion in foreign assets - - including properties in latin america and a power plant in india embroiled in a dispute with the state government - - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of enron ' s problems and the souring economy .
' ' as enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs , they may have to write those assets down , ' ' ms . coale said . on wednesday , she downgraded her rating on enron to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' neutral . ' '
' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts , ' ' ms . coale said .
short - sellers , who attacked enron ' s accounting even before the company disclosed the write - off , say the company ' s problems may run even deeper than analysts fear . enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money - losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business , they say .
' ' the company still isn ' t disclosing enough to know whether the core business , the trading business , is profitable , ' ' said mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , which recommended shorting enron ' s stock on may 7 , when it stood at $ 59 . 43 . ' ' the issue remains : why are they doing these transactions ? our theory has been that the core operations aren ' t that profitable . ' '
james chanos , a leading short - seller who has bet that enron ' s stock will fall , said , ' ' is enron booking gains when it has real profits , but hiding the losses when deals go against it ? ' ' mr . palmer of enron said the company stood by its reported energy - trading profits .
even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of enron ' s positions . enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset , in roughly equivalent amounts , by energy it has agreed to buy .
' ' with these guys , they tell us - - and all you ' ve got is their word - - that they ' re hedged , ' ' said mr . verleger , the economist .
in fact , enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations . last year , the company successfully lobbied congress to effectively ensure that its internet - trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission .
enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the federal energy regulatory commission , the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets . but the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices .
large - scale energy trading has existed for only about a half - dozen years . enron pioneered the business , and now dominates it , accounting for about one - quarter of all trading in the united states .
before congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity , a process that began in earnest a decade ago , the power business was a simpler affair . utilities were given areas of monopoly service , and their rates - - and ability to deliver enough electricity - - were overseen by state regulators . but with the move to deregulate the business , independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished , providing an ever - growing portion of the nation ' s power .
beginning in the 1980 ' s , the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated , spurring enron , which used to be primarily a gas - pipeline company , to move into the trading business .
the company ' s shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid - 1990 ' s , with the ascension of mr . skilling , who became chief executive in february , just six months before his unexpected resignation . underscoring the change in direction , in securities filings this year enron described its principal business as ' ' security brokers , dealers and flotation . ' ' before , it had said it was in the business of ' ' wholesale - petroleum and petroleum products . ' '
for most of its ascent , enron reported outstanding profit figures and wall street accepted them with pleasure . a year ago , when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by mr . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer , analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of mr . fastow ' s involvement .
enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch . but the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short - term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring . the controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - - unless enron loses its investment - grade credit rating before that .
enron will also need to maintain its large trading positions , which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about enron ' s credit . when long - term capital was stumbling in 1998 , some wall street rivals sold the securities they thought long - term owned , trying to force long - term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss . something similar in energy markets might be possible . if so , enron might find , as long - term did , that positions that should offset each other do not .
enron ' s new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company ' s profits are real , and that its condition is better than the short - sellers believe . as questions are answered , confidence , and the share price , could rebound .
but for now , investors are skittish , and some competitors are eager to take advantage of enron ' s plight .

plumbing mystery of deals by enron

c . 2001 new york times company
at the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the enron corporation are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , beginning in the summer of 1999 . because they were transactions among related parties , the company was required to disclose them , but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered . following are some questions that investors are asking , and the currently available answers .
q . why did enron enter into the deals ?
a . enron ' s first disclosures , in 1999 , gave no reason . in later reports , it said it was seeking to ' ' hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , ' ' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies .
q . how did those investments do ?
a . it looks as if they plunged in value , although there is no clear disclosure on that .
q . why can ' t that be discerned ?
a . the company never said just what the investments were . and the transactions with the partnerships were complicated , involving a variety of derivative securities , enron stock and various promissory notes . enron ' s financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely .
q . why were they so complicated ?
a . one reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage . one accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock . if a company sells its shares at $ 10 each and then buys them back - - whether for $ 1 or $ 50 - - there is no gain or loss . but shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet - - in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in , or paid out , on the transactions . enron ' s transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule .
q . who made money from these transactions ?
a . enron reported some profits along the way from the deals , although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings . and it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors .
q . if the deals began in 1999 , why all the uproar now ?
a . many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well . as long as enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter , they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important .
q . when were concerns raised with enron ?
a . the complaints grew as enron ' s share price fell earlier this year . by this summer , enron decided that mr . fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships . then , because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to enron , the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions . but investors were still worried , and enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships .
q . how did enron do ?
a . badly . it took a $ 35 million loss , which , given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken , was not very much . but it also reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
q . how did that happen ?
a . that , like so much else , is not clear . but it looks as if the partnership owed enron that much money , could not pay and was let off the hook by enron . in return , enron terminated ' ' previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver enron shares in future periods . ' ' enron treated that like a share buyback , even though the shares in question had not been issued , and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings .
q . is that legal under the accounting rules ?
a . presumably it is . but enron ' s limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure . enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements , while leaving profits on them . that may become clearer when the securities and exchange commission , which has begun preliminary inquiries , completes its work . floyd norris

investors seem to ignore discouraging news

investors sent stocks markedly higher last week , despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor .
the dow jones industrial average , strengthened by triple - digit rallies on monday and thursday , ended the week nearly back to its level of sept . 10 , one day before the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on sept . 10 .
investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected . they also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago , at some companies by more than 30 percent .
all the bad news , investors seemed to surmise , meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy , with tax breaks , spending and lower interest rates .
the dow average gained 341 . 06 , or 3 . 7 percent , to close at 9 , 545 . 17 . the nasdaq composite index rose 97 . 65 points , or 5 . 8 percent , to 1 , 768 . 96 . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index rose 31 . 13 , or 2 . 9 percent , to 1 , 104 . 61 .

itc says imports hurt steel industry
the international trade commission ruled that foreign imports pose a serious threat to the domestic steel industry , paving the way for punitive sanctions that are likely to raise steel prices and intensify trade tensions with europe and asia .
the independent u . s . agency has until mid - december to provide the white house with a list of proposed remedies , which could include import quotas or hefty tariffs on foreign steel .
beleaguered u . s . steelmakers applauded the decision .
president bush , who instigated the itc investigation , is expected to approve the protective measures , though critics warn they could harm a weakened domestic economy and complicate efforts to launch a new round of global trade talks .

shares of enron plummet amid losses
enron corp . ' s stock was pummeled by investors following disclosures of losses and shrinking shareholders ' equity related to failed investments and a complicated hierarchy of limited partnerships used to shelter some enron assets .
the stock slide was compounded by disclosure of a securities and exchange commission inquiry into two of the partnership arrangements and by wall street worries about future cash flow and credit problems that might be caused by the investment vehicles .
two conference calls with analysts and investors failed to calm nerves , and several analysts lowered their recommendations on enron .
enron has reiterated that its finances are strong . and although analysts note that enron ' s core businesses remain sound , some analysts doubt that the usually taciturn company has revealed all of its problems .
to mollify investors , enron replaced its chief financial officer , who until recently headed the two partnerships the sec is eyeing .

houston is known as the "" energy capital of the world . "" and a glance around the downtown skyline proves the nickname is appropriate . houston skyscrapers bearing the names of enron , chevron , exxon and shell make significant contributions to the view .
now another name is being added to the downtown mix , enhancing the energy capital image even further . the 36 - story two allen center has been renamed devon energy tower .
devon energy has just signed a lease for 193 , 000 square feet of space , more than doubling its presence in the building , and as part of the deal , devon gets to put its name on the structure .
the lease also gives oklahoma city - based devon the right to take more space in the 1 million - square - foot building , at 1212 smith st .
devon recently announced its plans to acquire mitchell energy & development , but it will maintain mitchell ' s offices in the woodlands , said klay kimker , manager of office administration for devon .
kevin snodgrass and tim relyea of cushman & wakefield represented devon in the transaction . paul frazier and margaret sigur negotiated the deal on behalf of trizechahn office properties , the owner of the building .
trizechahn owns both the allen center and cullen center office complexes , a total of 6 million square feet of space in downtown . the trizechahn office space is nearly full right now , but enron will be vacating large amounts of space there next year when the nearby enron building is complete .
teamsters to build facilities
teamsters union officials are planning to build new headquarters facilities after the union sells its building on the katy freeway .
to replace the katy freeway building , the union expects to build two smaller structures near bush intercontinental airport to house different chapters , said a . w . parker , secretary treasurer of local 968 .
parker ' s group is expecting to build a 13 , 000 - square - foot building at ella boulevard at beltway 8 .
another teamsters group has purchased 4 . 5 acres on beltway 8 at diplomatic plaza drive , in the world houston business center . the land was purchased from the licha family trust . tony patronella and marc drumwright , both of southwest realty advisors , handled the sale .
chicago firm buying property
a chicago real estate investment firm is on a quest to acquire suburban office buildings in houston .
ml capital ventures has purchased two small office structures : the 71 , 736 - square - foot building at 5500 northwest central drive and the 66 , 338 - square - foot building at 5301 hollister . the building on northwest central drive is the headquarters of bj services energy company .
mike luecht , president of ml capital , said his firm will acquire two additional houston office buildings before the end of the year .
ml capital , which has been in business for eight months , will exceed luecht ' s initial plan to buy more than $ 22 million worth of suburban office space in houston in the company ' s start - up phase .
luecht said his firm was bullish on two types of real estate : buying warehouses in chicago and buying office buildings in suburban houston . houston ' s economy has been adding jobs and it is a promising market that is overlooked by many investors , luecht said . many investors have been too slow to forget the devastating meltdown of houston realty market in the 1980 s , luecht said .
in its most recent deal , ml ventures bought the 5500 northwest central building in partnership with avgeris & associates of chicago . tom bousquet of cb richard ellis brokered the deal .

enron taps all its credit lines to buy back $ 3 . 3 billion of debt
by floyd norris

c . 2001 new york times company
the enron corporation , trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity , began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday , using $ 3 . 3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit .
an enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $ 1 billion in cash .
the moves did not appear to reassure investors , as enron ' s share price fell to another six - year low . shares traded as low as $ 15 . 04 yesterday , before ending the day at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents .
the move will raise the interest expense for the company , because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market , and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $ 1 billion .
enron ' s debt is rated investment grade . but its bonds now trade below investment grade levels , although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default . but with the bonds trading so low , it is unlikely enron will be able to sell more commercial paper .
enron ' s stock has been plunging since oct . 17 , shortly after it disclosed that its third - quarter balance sheet , which has yet to be released , will show a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by andrew fastow , who was the company ' s chief financial officer until he was replaced on wednesday .
the stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement , and the company has disclosed that the securities and exchange commission has asked questions about its accounting practices .

companies & finance international - enron ' s bond prices drop to warning levels .

enron , the houston - based energy trading group , continued to pay a heavy price for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plummeted .
investor confidence in enron has declined sharply since the company announced a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off - balance sheet structure . the securities and exchange commission has also launched an informal investigation into the company ' s finances .
enron ' s five - year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11 . 13 per cent , down from 83 cents on thursday . bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy .
late on thursday , enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to buy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the company on negative watch .
commercial paper financing , which normally has to be rolled every 90 days , is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis .
"" what they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners that they are creditworthy and continue with business , "" said robin west , chairman of the petroleum finance company , the industry consultants . "" in a situation like this , cash is king . ""
enron ' s biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterparties , such as duke energy and reliant resources , start asking it for more collateral , increasing the cost of its everyday business .
if enron were downgraded to junk , the counterparties could do just that .
so far , credit rating analysts say , enron ' s core business is holding up well . but their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company could still be severely damaged by the scandal .
enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting , but its most recent problems stem from the ljm private equity fund run by andy fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer .
enron compensated its partners in this complex off - balance sheet structure by promising to give them enron shares , if the value of private equity investments in the new power company , technology and other things fell below a certain level .
those investments fell $ 1 . 2 bn in value from the threshold level , which should have triggered the issue of 62 m shares if the deal had not been reversed .
the complex deal was designed to make sure enron did not experience the same balance sheet volatility that jp morgan chase and others have suffered from marking their private equity investments to market .

houston ( ap ) - after enron corp . tapped into more than $ 3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers , stock prices dropped .
enron corp . ' s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years friday . shares fell 95 cents on friday to $ 15 . 40 , a level not seen since 1995 , as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company ' s earnings announcement earlier this month .
the stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks , and the company lost almost $ 14 billion in market value .
late this week the company decided to convert $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash . the company put about $ 1 . 1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $ 2 . 2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short - term corporate iou known as commercial paper .
"" nothing spells confidence quite like cash , which is what we want investors to understand , "" said enron spokesman mark palmer of the $ 1 . 1 billion banked this week .
palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "" good management decisions . ""
on oct . 16 enron ' s third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board ' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest .
the partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron .
fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise .
the securities and exchange commission ' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence .
reducing the company ' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron ' s investors , said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan .
"" it helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business , which is really the core of their operations , "" feygin told the houston chronicle for saturday ' s editions .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities , still sees the move as somewhat confusing .
"" just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus , but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange , mixed message , "" she said . "" do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back ? is it a gesture for customers ? it first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management . ""

houston - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 - billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low - interest , short - term loans .
the company ' s stock has fallen 54 % in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 % , to $ 15 . 40 on the new york stock exchange .
investors said chief executive kenneth lay has failed to reassure them that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets , where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer .
"" do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , "" said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth third bancorp . "" people are questioning the credibility of management . ""
the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark palmer said .
the price of enron ' s 6 . 75 % bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 11 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of bbb + , yield 9 . 53 % .
investors have grown concerned that the firm ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions .
enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was "" a smart financial move , "" said stephen moore of moody ' s investors service . "" it took away the hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital . ""

enron corp . ' s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years friday after it tapped into more than $ 3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re - assure investors and customers .

palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "" good management decisions . ""
enron ' s most recent woes began oct . 16 when its third - quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about : then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , with the enron board ' s approval , had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest .
the partnerships , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , did complex financing and hedging deals with enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company ' s newer businesses such as broadband trading .
fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when wall street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously . but last week when the company reported a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity , new questions began to arise .
the securities and exchange commission ' s division of enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships , and earlier this week fastow was put on a leave of absence .
now enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper . this is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer , and often with more flexible terms .
"" to some extent , redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets , which look at it negatively , "" said anatol feygin , an analyst with j . p . morgan .
but reducing the company ' s debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools , like a revolving line of credit , could give great peace of mind to enron ' s investors , he said .
"" it helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business , which is really the core of their operations , "" feygin said .

"" do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back ? is it a gesture for customers ? it first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management . ""
jeff dietert , an analyst at simmons & co . , said enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned .
in a worst - case scenario , investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down , which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of enron . that could lead to lower credit ratings , which would force enron ' s energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it .
"" thus , we see a big incentive for enron to clarify the issues , "" dietert wrote in a report friday . "" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off . ""
feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store .
for example , a wall street journal article friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to enron known as chewco . it was formed in 1997 with about $ 400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed enron assets .
chewco was run by michael kopper , a managing director of enron ' s global equity markets group .

enron corp . filed suit against microsoft corp . in state district court in houston this week , claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high - speed internet service .
the companies entered into an agreement last june in which enron would provide internet bandwidth to microsoft as it rolled out its msn broadband service . enron ' s broadband network would link msn customers in over two dozen states , including texas .
qwest communications is providing the internet infrastructure in 14 other states for msn .
on oct . 23 , microsoft said that enron would have breached the contract if it didn ' t provide an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , according to bloomberg news . in the lawsuit , enron claims microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project ' s first phase .
the lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the msn service in all but the 14 states served by qwest .
enron officials declined to comment . a microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was "" confident that we have upheld our agreement with enron . ""

how to lose a war
by frank rich
10 / 27 / 2001
the new york times
page 19 , column 2
c . 2001 new york times company
welcome back to sept . 10 .
the ' ' america strikes back ' ' optimism that surged after sept . 11 has now been stricken by the multitude of ways we ' re losing the war at home . the f . b . i . has proved more effective in waging turf battles against rudy giuliani than waging war on terrorism . of the more than 900 suspects arrested , exactly zero have been criminally charged in the world trade center attack ( though one has died of natural causes , we ' re told , in a new jersey jail cell ) . the bush team didn ' t fully recognize that a second attack on america had begun until more than a week after the first casualty . the most highly trumpeted breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists - - tom ridge ' s announcement that ' ' the site where the letters were mailed ' ' had been found in new jersey - - proved a dead end . and now the president is posing with elementary - school children again .
given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with c . e . o . clockwork , perhaps it should be added to the growing list of things that have changed forever since sept . 11 . but let ' s not be so hasty . not everything changes that fast - - least of all washington . the white house ' s home - front failures are not sudden , unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since jan . 20 .
this is an administration that will let its special interests - - particularly its high - rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right - - have veto power over public safety , public health and economic prudence in war , it turns out , no less than in peacetime . when anthrax struck , the administration ' s first impulse was not to secure as much cipro as speedily as possible to protect americans , but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer . the white house ' s faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week ' s house ' ' stimulus ' ' package showering $ 254 million on enron , the reeling houston energy company ( now under s . e . c . investigation ) that has served as a bush campaign cash machine .
airport security , which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since sept . 11 , is also held hostage by campaign cash : as salon has reported , servicemaster , a supplier of the low - wage employees who ineptly man the gates , is another g . o . p . donor . not that republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first . in a display of bipartisanship , democrats - - lobbied by linda hall daschle , the senate majority leader ' s wife - - joined the administration in handing the airlines a $ 15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry ' s c . e . o . ' s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees .
to see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security , you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation - - and one that explains the recent trials of poor tom ridge .
mr . ridge is by all accounts a capable leader - - a successful governor of a large state ( pennsylvania ) who won the bronze star for heroism in vietnam . a close friend of george w . bush , he should have been in the administration from the get - go , and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs , including the vice presidency . but after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights , he got zilch . instead of mr . ridge , the administration signed on the pro - life john ashcroft and tommy thompson - - who have brought us where we are today .
the farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations - - though mr . thompson often comes across as a chamber of commerce glad - hander who doesn ' t know his pants are on fire , and mr . ashcroft often shakes as if he ' s not just seen great caesar ' s ghost but perhaps john mitchell ' s as well . both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration . they ' ve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their no . 1 concern .
pre - sept . 11 , mr . thompson , in defiance of science , heartily lent his credibility to the bush administration ' s stem cell ' ' compromise ' ' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers . post - sept . 11 , he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat , also in defiance of science . now he maintains that the $ 1 . 5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system - - almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals , not shoring up local hospitals - - is adequate for fighting bioterrorism . this , too , is in defiance of all expert estimates , including that of the one physician in the senate , the republican bill frist .
it should also be on mr . thompson ' s conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government ' s house physician - - david satcher , the surgeon general and a much - needed honest broker of public health - - locked away , presumably because dr . satcher , a clinton appointee , became persona non grata in the bush administration for issuing a june report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right . only after mr . ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag .
as for mr . ashcroft , he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons . planned parenthood , which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them , has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one . this was true not only before sept . 11 but , says ann glazier , planned parenthood ' s director of security , remains true - - even though her organization , long targeted by such home - grown talibans as the army of god , has a decade ' s worth of leads on ' ' the convergence of international and domestic terrorism . ' '
ms . glazier found the sight of mr . ashcroft and other federal keystone kops offering a $ 1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy . ' ' religious extremists don ' t respond to money , ' ' she points out . such is the state of the f . b . i . , she adds , that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ' ' because we have so many here we ' re afraid we ' re going to lose it ' ' ( perhaps among the timothy mcveigh documents ) .
if either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that , say , mayor giuliani does , there wouldn ' t have been a need to draft mr . ridge . even so , he ' s mainly a p . r . gimmick - - a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights . as director of homeland security , he ' s allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies - - so far with roughly a dozen staff members . when asked to define mr . ridge ' s responsibilities , ari fleischer said on wednesday that it was ' ' a very busy coordination job , ' ' but so far mr . ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion .
the one specific duty that he has claimed - - in an interview with tom brokaw - - was that he ' d be the one ' ' making the phone call ' ' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers . that presumably comes as news to donald rumsfeld , who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the air force chain of command he publicly codified days after mr . ridge ' s appointment .
since the administration tightly metes out the news from afghanistan , we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here - - even as mr . rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the taliban , once expected to implode in days , are proving viet - cong - like in their intractability . the wall street journal also reported this week that ' ' instead of a thankful afghan population , popular support for the taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the u . s . growing . ' '
maybe we ' re losing that battle for afghan hearts and minds in part because the bush state department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a c . e . o . ( from madison avenue ) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like head & shoulders shampoo . if we can ' t effectively fight anthrax , i guess it ' s reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff .

city - enron directors cash in shares .

( c ) telegraph group limited , london , 2001
leading executives at enron , the troubled us energy giant , cashed in shares worth more than $ 100 m ( # 70 m ) this year in the run - up to a financial crunch that has left the company ' s credibility in ruins .
research by thomson financial shows that kenneth lay , chief executive , sold about 400 , 000 shares this year , netting him more than $ 25 m . he still held 2 . 8 m shares until july .
other executives made similar sales , a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $ 83 at the start of the year to $ 45 by july . they halved again this week and fell to below $ 16 yesterday . enron declined to comment on the share sales .
mr lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "" dispel uncertainty in the financial community "" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in enron ' s financial strength . enron will pay off debts of $ 2 . 2 billion and keep another $ 800 , 000 in cash . he said : "" we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community . ""
the company is facing an inquiry by the securities & exchange commission into partnerships managed by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer .
mr fastow was ousted on wednesday night as part of the company ' s moves to restore confidence , though enron insists he has done nothing wrong .
enron lost $ 1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "" failed investments "" .

india : lenders to meet over enron ' s dabhol on nov 3 .
10 / 27 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
bombay , oct 27 ( reuters ) - lenders to power plant in india majority owned by enron corp have called a meeting next week in london to discuss ways of reviving the beleaguered project , a banking source said on saturday .
they will examine offers that two indian companies have put forward for buying the u . s . energy giant ' s 65 percent stake , and those of two other u . s . firms , in dabhol power company ( dpc ) , which is building the controversial project , the source told reuters .
the meeting of lenders , who include multinational banks such as citibank and bank of america , will be held on november 3 , the source added .
at stake is not just the fate of the $ 2 . 9 billion , 2 , 184 mw project , which is india ' s largest foreign direct investment , but also the over $ 600 million investment of enron , general electric co and bechtel .
all three companies are founders of dpc , which in 1995 got permission from india ' s maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast .
the plant ' s first phase of 740 mw was completed in 1999 , but work on the second phase of 1 , 444 mw , which is 97 percent complete , was abruptly stopped in june this year following a blazing row with cash - strapped state utility mseb .
mseb , which agreed in 1995 to take the plant ' s entire output , said it can no longer do so because dabhol ' s power is too costly .
dabhol , in turn , accused mseb of defaulting on its monthly payments and served a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract .
under this notice , both companies are given six months time to settle the matter through negotiations . if talks fail , dabhol has the right to issue a final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in london . that six month period expires on november 19 .
houston - based enron , which owns 65 percent of dabhol , further announced that it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the indian government .
time running out
the business standard newspaper reported that next week ' s meeting would also discuss a request by dabhol to finally terminate the contract after november 19 .
"" it is one of the items on the agenda , "" the paper quoted a senior banker as saying .
the paper said once dabhol serves the final notice , the matter proceeds to arbitration , which would not help india .
"" the widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation dpc will win hands down , "" the paper added .
a dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately .
the source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far .
the indian government has not responded to enron ' s offer to buy its equity , but two indian companies , bses ltd and tata power ltd , have shown interest .
they have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced , and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount .
local business daily , the economic times reported on friday that tata power and bses are willing to pay the founders $ 450 - $ 600 million for the 85 percent stake held by enron , ge and bechtel .
enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $ 1 billion , the paper added .
officials of tata power and bses were not immediately available for comment .

houston - - enron has sued microsoft , alleging it breached a contract for broadband services , in a move that could temporarily block the largest software company ' s msn high - speed internet service in some u . s . regions .
microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing the high - speed service in areas where enron provides broadband access , leaving msn fully operational only in the 14 states - - including washington - - where qwest communications international operates , said bob visse , director of marketing for msn .
enron ' s lawsuit was filed thursday , the same day microsoft had planned to offer fast internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential customers in 29 million homes . microsoft , the no . 2 u . s . internet provider , is making a push to win customers from aol time warner .
"" we are trying to resolve the issues with enron , as quickly as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other providers , "" visse said .
enron spokeswoman karen denne declined to comment on the lawsuit , citing company policy on pending litigation . enron , based in houston , is the largest energy trader .
enron in june signed an agreement with microsoft to provide bandwidth for msn internet service . under the agreement , enron isn ' t required to deliver operational broadband services if microsoft hasn ' t first provided a billing and ordering system , dow jones news wire reported .
enron claims in its lawsuit that microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of the deal , dow reported .
alternative browser - users denied microsoft entry
new york - - microsoft ' s premier web portal , msn . com , denied entry to millions of people who use alternative browser software such as opera and told them to get microsoft ' s products instead .
the decision led to complaints from the small but loyal opera community that microsoft was abusing its status as the internet ' s browser leader . microsoft later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other browsers after all .
browser products affected by the shutout , which was triggered by a face - lift of the msn . com web site , included opera , mozilla and amaya , said kevin reichard , editorial manager for internet . com ' s browserwatch site .
mike pettit , president of procomp , an anti - microsoft group , urged state and federal investigators to look into the matter as part of its lawsuit accusing microsoft of anti - competitive practices .

microsoftsf to shut down ; sony will run retail store
san francisco - - sony will take over a retail store it manages with microsoft next month , when the biggest software maker ' s xbox goes up against sony ' s playstation 2 in a contest for control of the $ 20 billion video - game market , a sony spokeswoman said .
the two companies agreed to shut down microsoftsf , a retail outlet in sony ' s san francisco metreon entertainment complex . it will be replaced with a digital solutions electronics store run by sony on thursday , metreon spokeswoman kirsten maynard said .
in april 1998 , the companies said they would open the store that displays and sells microsoft products alongside sony electronics that run the software . in march 2000 , microsoft announced the xbox , a game console with an advanced - graphics chip that goes on sale nov . 15 .
"" a lot has changed with both companies , "" maynard said . "" it sort of became not - a - fit anymore . ""
sony metreon won ' t carry the xbox or game cube , a new video console from nintendo that goes on sale nov . 19 , she said . officials at microsoft couldn ' t be reached for comment on the shutdown .

sir / madam , compliments of the season !
i am haja mariam abacha , a widow to late general sanni abacha ,
nigeria ' s former military head of states who died on the 8 th of june , 1998 of
cardiac arrest . since the death of my husband both the immediate , past
and incumbent government of my country , nigeria , have been persecuting
my family . the present government of chief olusegun obasanjo have turned
the klieglight of investigations into the actvities of my family .
the government have directed all the banks in my country to freeze the
accounts belonging to my family and our numerous business concerns of
every member of my family including those of my uncles to a stop . and my
most senior son , mohammed was arrested by the nigerian government , and
later released on bail with strick conditions . while all our foreign
bank accounts have been freezed aided by a publication in the financial
times of london of friday 23 rd july , 1999 , though my husband was not the
only past official accused of having money in foreign banks .
i am therefore using this medium to solicit for your assistance . your
business profile and name were given to me in confidence by the nigerian
chambers of commerce and industry ( foreign trade division ) . the
information regarding the viability of your business concern gingered me into
soliciting for your help . now , since the present government of my
country is hell - bent on prosecuting , disgracing the good name and image of
my entire family and possibly doing more damages to our financial base .
i am therefore desirous of handling over the remains of my late
husband ' s money , us $ 36 million ( thirty - six million united states dollars only )
which is presently safely and secretly kept in coded cash in a security
company outside my country to evade confiscation by the nigerian
government or its agents .
please , if you are interested in helping my family move this money into
your private or company account , kindly inform me through my e - mail
address above . after the movement of this huge sum of money out of its
secret place into your country , i plan to give you 30 % of the total sum ,
while 30 % will be plunged into your business concern as shares or for
high profile investment purposes in your country . then , the rest 40 % shall
be used to settle my entire family who have reached advanced stage to
migrate abroad for political asylum . for your information , my fear
grief - stricken children have the blessing of this business transaction . it
is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on
trust and i would also kindly appeal that you keep this proposed
transaction most top secret .
your immediate response should be communicated to my private e - mail
address : marianabacha 2 @ ummah . org so that all machineries concerning this
transaction will be swung into action .
thank you very much for showing interest . i iook forward to hearing
from you soon .

269,3656,cleburne issues,"daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .

275,11294,fountain valley,"we had a bad accident at the construction site on friday . a construction worker slipped and fell in front of a bulldozer . over the weekend he had his foot amputated . we have flown his family in and put them up at a ronald mcdonald house ( non - profit institution for families of injured / ill patients ) . the worker was employed by a sub - contractor of cig , the pipeline company that is constructing the gas lateral for fountain valley power llc .
nepco is making some noise because they want it to be clear that this was not a nepco subcontractor and therefore not nepco responsibility . we do not think this will materially delay closing the sale to black hills , but we will likely need to indemnify them from the litigation risk associated with this accident . we are working with legal and insurance to assess risk and process .

276,12582,california update - - 08 . 27 . 01,"the california puc
loretta lynch held a press conference in sacramento today to discuss changes to the commission ' s previously released proposal regarding direct access and the rate agreement between the puc and dwr .
in the amended proposal discussed and distributed today , direct access would end retroactive to july 1 . customers with contracts executed as of july 1 would would remain direct access customers .
the legislature
the assembly version of the senate mou ( sb 78 ) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the committee .
it is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6 : 30 pm pdt today .
amendments on direct access were released this afternoon ( based on negotiations between davis ' office and business customers ) :
customers who have consistently been da since may 2000 , including those "" involuntarily "" returned to bundled service , would be exempt from charges for edison ' s undercollection , dwr ' s forward contracts , and dwr - related exit fees , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers .
customers who have consistently been on da between may 2000 and jan 17 , 2001 would be exempt from charges for edison ' s undercollection , dwr ' s forward contracts and dwr - realted exit fees , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers .
customers who have been on da between jan 17 , 2001 and august 24 , 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to dwr forward contracts , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers .
customer ' s leaving after august 24 th would not qualify for exemptions .
there is considerable work underway to make the august 24 th date the deadline for contract execution , rather than the date by which the customer must be dasr ' d , in order to qualify for the exemptions .
direct access would not be suspended , however , until 90 days after the bill is signed by davis ( if he signs it ) , i . e . , the "" effective date "" of the bill .
so anyone going to direct access between aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions .
after the 90 - day period , da would be suspended until 1 . 1 . 03 .
self - gen in service consistently from may 200 to august 24 would be exempt from edison ' s undercollection and dwr charges .
self - gen that submitted an application to the energy commission by august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self - gen comes on line .
self - gen that comes on line after august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self - gen comes on line , but the total number of exempt mws in this category would be limited to 250 mws per year , on a first - come - first - serve basis .
at least 30 % of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen .",ham,2001-08-27

clayton -
sorry it took so long to get back to you . there are a couple of things to
keep in mind :
- enron it supports enron equipment .
- all equipment must be purchased through "" enron it purchasing ""
our current high end desktop is a 800 mhz pentium iii machine with 128 m of
ram . you can bump up the ram to whatever you feel is appropriate . when the lghz processors come out ( in the very near future ) that will become our
standard .
what we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for .
the "" image "" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when
it is deployed . if you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image
for , we can ' t support it for a multitude of reasons .
hopefully this answered your questions / concerns .
if not , please call me so that we can discuss this further .
thanks

i have received a call from mit asking if enron would be interested in
sponsoring a financial engineering pro - seminar .
this means that enron would propose a problem that would have its solution
developed by students in the financial engineering track . these students
would present the findings in the end .
i think that enron has already sponsored a financial engineering pro - seminar .
i remember something about real options at the time i was at school .
please , let me know if enron has the interest , specifically the research .
talking here at the weather desk , mark tawney expressed interest . if you
agree , we ( the weather desk ) could co - sponsor this pro - seminar with the
research . the idea , then , would be to propose a problem connected to weather
trading .
please , give me your thoughts about this issue .
thanks ,

315,24274,info you requested kcc,"thank you for your interest !
judgment coursesoffers an extensive training
course in "" how to collect moneyjudgments ""
if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a
money judgment is and why processing money judgments
can earn you very substantial income .
if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a money judgment against them .
you are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the
judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you .
the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser
down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts ,
real estate , stocks and bonds , etc .
very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found . the result is that millions of
judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten .
in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a
dime .
the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions . right now in the united states there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney
judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more
judgments take its place .
we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this
business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed .
with our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing money judgments .
by following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of money judgments .
the income potential is substantial in this profession . we
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per
year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00
and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices .
today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in money judgments that we are currently
processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates .
joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break
even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on
the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies , police
officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us
for reports .
many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars .
legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 %
interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments .
annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to
$ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the
payment of the principal .
our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per
year . this is just for interest , not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income . typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars .
92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 %
are women and 36 % are part time .
one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are
working on will be there when you return . the judgments
are still in force , they do not disappear .
the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you
never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you
are . you are not a collection agency .
simply stated the steps to successful money processing
are as follows :
mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who
to write to )
8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them
unless you want to .
you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and
50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for
$ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 .
you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you . they range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment
locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc .
the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to
1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge
$ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $ 25 . 00 .
once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located .
( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course )
when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to
the original judgment holder .
once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of
judgment to the court . ( included in the course )

vnbl stock expected to explode ! ! !
vinoble is the next hot play in homeland security
symbol : vnbl . ob
current price : $ o . 08
short term target price : $ o . 5 o
12 month target price : $ 4 . oo
deserves your immediate attention ! ! !
the company just bottomed at $ o . 06 and we believe in the next 1 to 2
weeks this stock will go back to at least $ 0 . 40
c o m p a n y o v e r v i e w
vinoble , inc . ( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and
acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland
security , security information systems , and other security services to
provide long term growth for its shareholders .
vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in
the security sector is unprecedented .
the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have
changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both
physical
and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments ,
especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the
focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security
services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of
forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products
and
services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 .
vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security
market by delivering professional services , security products , security
training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective ,
vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals
offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s
consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will
help
organizations protect key assets including persons , property ,
information ,
brand , and reputation .
homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the
healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) ,
sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued
increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble
intends
to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical
and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients ,
alliance
partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are
the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious
provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of
each
client .
management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( "" gccc "" ) to assist
in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such
acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at
present ,
vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential
acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and
audits , the
company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis
required for listing on a national exchange .
here is recent news on the company :
malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 20 , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb :
vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information
systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it
continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition
of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps
tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional
businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software ,
and patents .
following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification )
technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use
applications , the company has concluded that the need for application
support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the
framework which operates such technology . the company has identified
several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software ,
and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element .
middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both
internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves
routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into
different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web
services and service - oriented architectures .
since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and
non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling
customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important
in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with
customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of
assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the
manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will
enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to
shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply
chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid
and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system .
the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology
will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing
rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide
critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of
businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and
assets in this current state of constant threat .

327,29058,message from ken lay,"earlier today , i stepped down as enron ' s chairman of the board and chief executive officer . this decision was reached in cooperation with enron ' s board and the creditor committee and is effective immediately .
to emerge from bankruptcy , enron needs a ceo who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company . unfortunately , with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention , at this time i am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to enron ' s stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees .
the creditor committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim ceo to help the company emerge from bankruptcy . this individual will join enron ' s remaining management team to direct the company ' s ongoing operations .
i truly believe enron can and will survive . i will remain a director of the board to help see that it does .
during my time at enron , i have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity . i have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world ' s most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks ; i have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets ; i have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like enrononline ; and i have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community . regardless of what has happened , i am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here .
thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years .

343,11724,western update 5 / 7 / 01,"executive summary
? the likely outcome of the 16 may elections is a victory by the bc liberal party ( currently holding polls at 70 % ) , a pro - business , right - of - center party led by gordon campbell .
? major changes in british columbia energy policy are likely under a liberal government .
? a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed by us power consumers could force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire
? bc hydro ' s additional generation at williston is likely undeliverable
liberal party platform
? income tax cut that would make bc ' s income tax the lowest in canada
? independent audit of the province ' s books amid allegations of ndp mismanagement and incompetence
? review of all crown corporations ( including bc hydro ) to enhance efficiency and management quality
? campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the corporate capital tax , the machinery equipment tax and the corporate income tax .
energy agenda
according to sources , under the liberal party ' s rule , significant changes in the bc government ' s energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some bc hydro assets , perhaps including its transmission assets , as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coal - fired production . at the same time , a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the province ' s overall energy strategy over the next few years . campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coal - fired production . campbell calls thermal coal , "" an asset that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in bc . "" a high - ranking ndp source believes that campbell will take the province back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new technology . the source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists . "" these are confrontational moves , and people will be on the streets . ""
campbell ' s most likely choice for energy minister is richard neufeldt , though we caution that this decision depends on the make - up of the legislature after the election . neufeldt is responsible for the liberal party ' s energy , mining and northern development portfolio . sources speculate that if right - wing liberals are dissatisfied with the party ' s performance after the may election , neufeldt could again defect to the opposition . however , this gives campbell even greater incentive to name neufeldt energy minister , a high - profile position .
should the liberals win the election , gordon campbell has indicated that he would return bc hydro to regulation by the bc utilities commission . the bc government has derived $ 5 . 5 billion in revenue from bc hydro since 1991 ( roughly 85 percent of its profit ) . critics say this has undermined the utility ' s ability to pay down approximately $ 7 . 5 billion in debt and invest in the future . this also has left hydro without a rate stabilization fund , something that sources feel may be needed this year . campbell reportedly intends to address these issues , and one can expect this to lead to calls for change .
electricity export policy
currently the bc utilities commission is demanding more information about bc hydro ' s out - of - province sales . the commission has warned that , given the low snow pack , the utility could be a net importer of power this year . supporting this view , the northwest power planning council , representing bc hydro ' s key trading partners in the us , has said that it would not be able to rely upon british columbia or alberta during peak consumption periods over the next few years , and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses . the combination of a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to bc hydro by us consumers may force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire .
bc hydro privatization
a key campaign energy issue for the liberal party is the privatization of bc hydro . campbell has urged greater electricity competition , saying , "" we need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all , producers and consumers , on an equal and non - discriminatory basis . "" he stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn . "" i want to change that big time , "" he told the canadian institute of energy . campbell also urged more natural gas development , including pipelines and co - generation plants .
campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by ndp leader ujjal dosanjh . campbell stated on 25 april , "" we have no intention of selling bc hydro ; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines , no intention of selling their dams , we have no intention of selling their reservoirs . "" liberal party spokesman mike morton also reiterated on 29 april that bc hydro would not be for sale . a high - level ndp source commented that campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding bc hydro , essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams , transmission lines or generating stations , but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition .
however , local sources believe that some parts of bc hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of bc crown corporations to enhance efficiency . likely sale prospects include bc hydro ' s distribution channels and its energy trading subsidiary , powerex . in addition , gary farrell - collins , the liberal finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister ( after neufeldt ) , has stated that public ownership of bc hydro ' s non - core businesses , such as westech , its systems division , and customer billing , could come under review .
bc hydro williston generation
current reservoirs levels at bc hydro ' s williston hydro - generation facility are at 2 , 150 ft , which allows bc hydro to drop levels another 35 ft ( 170 gwhs / ft ) under their current permit . the one drawback to this plan ' s additional generation involves the mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2 , 140 ft . sources close to the minister of mines & energy - elect , richard neufeldt , indicate that levels at williston probably will not be drawn down below mackenzie ' s operational limits due to concern over political backlash .",ham,2001-05-07

susan and i will circulate a draft response against dynegy ' s position later today . comed plans to file a lengthy answer disputing dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm ld resources and that ferc precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement .
enron will respond similarly and include an argument that dynegy is actually trying to create an "" icap / capacity "" requirement where there is none ( dynegy ' s pleading states "" comed ' s failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its oatt also deprives dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled . ) we will also include statements that the continuation of the network v . ptp transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market / tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems .

subject : dynegy vs . comed ( elo 2 - 6 ) - - further info
as i mentioned in my previous e - mail , on october 17 dynegy filed a complaint against comed . this proceeding may be of particular interest to enron given ees ' s plans to offer physical delivery in illinois in early 2002 . i ' ve outlined dynegy ' s principal arguments below . dynegy requested fast - track processing , so any intervention and comments we file are due friday , oct . 26 . in order to file a timely intervention ( and meaningful comments , if we decide to comment ) , i need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible . elizabeth and harlan , i ' m copying you because i would especially like to know what you think of dynegy ' s characterization of the firm ld product .
main argument :
dynegy challenges comed ' s published business practice that allows "" marketer firm "" ( firm ld ) contracts to be designated as network resources . dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the oatt provisions that 1 ) network resources are generation "" owned , purchased or leased by the network customer designated to serve network load , "" and 2 ) a network customer "" must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract "" in order to designate a network resource .
dynegy ' s theory on why firm ld should not be a network resource :
- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others , creating reliability problems
- firm ld under the eei contract is not capacity - backed , nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
- since retail providers are allowed to rely on "" over - the - counter "" firm instead of securing long - term contracts , adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
dynegy claims that comed ' s practice has deprived dmg of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources . it cites specific instances in which comed has accepted transmission reservation requests from new energy and cilco in which these parties designated illinois power as a network resource , when only a firm ld contracts were in place with ip .

a company which has positioned itself in the gap between the major
media conglomerates and the universe of independent music , film , publishing
and technology companies .

like momentum .
breaking news ! !
pop 3 media corp . ( popt ) and roxxy corporation announced that the
companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby roxxy corporation will
acquire a 66 % interest in pop 3 ' s wholly owned subsidiary , viastar
distribution group , inc . "" vdg , "" forming a revolutionary new music company ,
controversial entertainment corporation . the transaction , consisting of
stock and cash , when completed , will provide pop 3 ' s shareholders with a
33 % stake in the new company .
roxxy ' s management will operate the company from headquarters in los
angeles and will change its corporate name to controversial entertainment
corporation in the coming weeks . the companies intend to complete and
execute the definitive agreement by july 8 th , 2005 , and seek shareholder
approval immediately thereafter .
pop 3 ' s ceo , john d . aquilino , stated , "" this alliance will allow pop 3 to
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music
industry . one that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they
create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media . ""
roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives
drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house
producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry
today .
"" it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major
labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that
cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million
selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists
that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , ""
stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo .
"" additionally , the acquisition of vdg will provide us with the ability
to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22 , 000 retail
location in north america , effectively doubling the company ' s net
profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our
artists . ""
mr . shebanow concluded , "" while there are smaller labels that do provide
a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have
on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great
producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the
customer that controversial entertainment will possess . ""
about pop 3 media corp :

industry . one that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they
create while embracing emerging technoiogies and giving consumers

roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives
drawn from the major labels and aiso includes a staff of in - house
producers who are among the most infiuentia | talents in the music industry
today .
"" it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major
labeis ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; | abeis that

mr . shebanow concluded , "" whiie there are sma | | er | abeis that do provide
a home for these acts , they lack either the wil | or financia | resources

attached is a memo comparing the cec ' s forecasted supply and a more realistic look at what additional resources might be available this summer .
the bottom line is that :
1 . the cec significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer . they estimate in their 5 , 000 mw supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around 3 , 000 mw . however , november and december saw significantly higher outage levels . ( 7 , 265 mws ) the ferc has investigated these outages and found no improprieties - just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities .
2 . there are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1 , 244 mws of projected supply from rerating / restarting existing thermal and renewable projects . it is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer , if at all . as evidenced by the e - mail i sent out this morning , local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units . in addition , these units are likely to be uneconomical .
3 . in the existing resource pool , there are roughly 1 , 430 mws of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations . the governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions , we are beginning to seem some movement ; however , the us epa has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards .
4 . the distributed generation / back - up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown . while there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back - up generation at "" essential public services "" the increase in dg is expected from "" clean "" sources , not diesel emergency generators .
5 . the cec is doing everything it can to get 50 + mw peaking units on - line by this summer . they are promising a 21 - day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets , for "" clean "" sources of generation in critical areas .
please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information .

395,1195,new paycheck information !,"introducing your first sap paycheck !
this is the first payroll processed in sap for all employees paid out of
corporate payroll . you may notice some changes in the way information is
reflected on your pay advice , the most common are itemized below .
what  , s different ?
? your  + home  , cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay advice .
this is your department number as designated in the hr and financial modules
of sap .
? any earnings descriptions that start with a  + p  , represent earning types
reported in the prior period . for instance , if you reported vacation time for
the july lst - 15 th pay period , it will be reflected on your july 31 st pay
advice as  + pvacation  , .
? flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead
of as a credit in the deduction section . the various benefit deductions will
remain itemized in the deduction section .
? if you transfer between enron companies during the year , your year  ) to - date
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice . previously , the
year - to - date totals started over when transferred to another company . this
change will provide your total enron earnings and deduction amounts on your
pay advice throughout the year . ( note that your w 2 at the end of the year
will reflect your earnings by company ) .
? for salaried employees , any reported exception time ( e . g . vacation , sick
day , etc . ) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only , the
related dollar amount will be included in the  + salary  , earnings type .
? for any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll
contact the payroll call center at 713 - 345 - 5555
payroll faq  , s
my paycheck has a line called  & other deductions  8 , what does that stand for ?
there is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck . for
some employees , the number of deductions are more than we have room to
print . in this circumstance , the system totals all remaining deductions and
prints them on one line  ) titled  & other deductions  8 . the detail of all
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet
at ehronline . enron . com .
what do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean ?
these definitions are listed on the payroll webpage located at
hrweb . enron . com , select enron payroll from the side index .
why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck ?
overtime is paid one pay period in arrears , therefore it will be reflected in
the next pay period . for example , if you reported overtime for the
july lst  ) 15 th pay period , it will be reflected on your july 31 st pay advice
as  + povertime  , .
what is the limit for social security ( fica ) ?
for year 2000 the limit is $ 4 , 724 . 40 on a wage base of $ 76 , 200 . this limit is
applied to each enron payroll tax company . therefore , if you transfer to
another enron company these limits will start over , however , the total amount
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub . excess fica
will be credited to you by the irs via your tax return .
what federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when i exercise stock
options ?
there is a standard federal income tax rate of 28 % for these earnings . this
can be higher if the employee has completed a supplemental tax form
requesting a higher rate ( this form can be found at hrweb . enron . com , select
enron payroll from the side index ) .",ham,2000-07-14

398,24455,could be your last chance for savings,"opportunity is knocking . why ?
because mortgage rates are rising .
as a national lender , not a broker , we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan .
rates may well never be this low again . this is
your chance to secure a better future . you could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you ' ve been wanting or to take that special
vacation . why pay more than you have to pay ?
we can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you . but only if you act now .
this is a free service . no fees of any kind .
you can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes . we only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them . we promise that you won ' t need
an attorney to see the savings .
we offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you . or why you should replace
it .
once again , there ' s no risk for you . none at all .
take two minutes and use the link ( s ) below that
works for you . let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family . don ' t let
opportunity pass you by . take action now .

399,27871,re : tw ios posting privileged & confidential,"christine , see the attached . i ' ve changed paragraph 8 to be like our last
posting , and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery ( but
omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time ) .
my only other comment is that i think the group needs to discuss beforehand
how a shipper ' s request for alternate points is going to be treated . as
currently drafted , this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on
use of alternate points at the bid rate , which calls into question our
granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount . if we do
intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt . points at a discounted
rate , we should take this statement out ( end of paragraph 5 ) .
if we ' re still living in a max . rate world , though , this really is not much
of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max . rate .
any questions - - give me a call .

subject : trade warehouse mtg - purpose
hi nicki ,
thanks for setting up the meeting next wednesday ( 9 / 20 ) at 2 : 30 with m .
frevert , d . delainey , j . shankman , and j . lavorato . here is a brief overview
of the meeting objective :
purpose
to gain support and approval for a data warehouse vision containing
consolidated trade information with centralized access .
background
the definition of a data warehouse is a place to consolidate information
originating from multiple transaction processing systems and platforms into a
common database repository . the idea of an enron  & trade warehouse  8
originated from members of the london office and has been expanded to include
the houston systems . the need for a trade warehouse stems from the
requirement of multiple departments needing to access consolidated deal
information for analytical reporting and down - stream processing . currently ,
deal information is held in separate trading systems both within product
process flows from mid to back office , and across product lines . the
information is also stored across multiple system platforms and is not easily
accessible or consistently presented across the various trading products
within enron . given this current architecture , it is very difficult and
costly to access timely , quality - assured , and consolidated cross - product deal
information for analytical reporting and down - stream processing .
proposal
houston will use the warehouse as the data source for entelligence and
numerous analytical reporting application systems . these analytical
reporting application systems can include , but are not limited to ,
operational pricing module ( opm ) , enrononline , and daily position report
( dpr ) . once the warehouse is in place , it may be used as the source for
additional downstream systems as well as investor relations reporting .",ham,2000-09-12

good morning ,
attached , please find the latest issue of our independent power weekly .
>
summary :
1 . ipps fall 5 . 1 % last week our ipp composite fell 5 . 1 % , outperforming the
nasdaq ( - 8 . 1 % ) , but lagging behind the s and , 2 . extend floating caps to other western
states .
3 . minimal impact on ipps we believe the expansion of the ferc ' s current
market mitigation plan will have an immaterial impact on the independent
power producers with california exposure - aes , cpn , mir , nrg , and rri . our
reasons are as follows : 1 ) the bulk of their capacity is sold forward ; 2 .
the ferc ' s methodology is benign ; and , 3 ) valuations already reflect
political uncertainty and normalized power prices .
4 . nrg hosts conference call on friday ( 6 / 15 ) , nrg hosted a conference call
to address investor concerns surrounding near - term equity needs , pending
acquisitions and recent regulatory developments . on the call management
noted that : 1 ) barring a major acquisition , it will not issue equity in the
near - term ; 2 ) nrg ' s pending acquisition of 1 , 767 mw of generation capacity
from conectiv should close by june 30 ; and , 3 ) expansion of the ferc ' s
western market mitigation measures should not impact nrg ' s performance .
also on the call , management reaffirmed its previous 2001 eps guidance of
$ 1 . 35 . . trading at 13 . 2 times our 2002 estimate versus a group average of
16 . 1 times , nrg represents the best relative value in the ipp group . we
believe this discount is unwarranted and reiterate our buy rating and $ 37
price target .
5 . review of orn analyst conference on tuesday ( 6 / 12 ) , orion power hosted
its first major investor conference in baltimore , maryland . the meeting
featured presentations from 10 senior managers . we do not believe investors
were previously aware of the full breadth and depth of the management team .
while no major announcements were made , the meeting served to confirm that
orn is on track to achieve its strategic and growth objectives .
6 . coverage of geg initiated with a buy rating on june 11 , 2001 csfb
initiated on global power equipment group ( geg ) with a buy rating and a
twelve - month price target of $ 42 . we co - cover geg with john mcginty - - csfb ' s
machinery analyst .

in recent discussions with christie , she has suggested that i liaise with
you and our management in preparation for your and vince kaminski ' s case
study . christie has forwarded recent emails sent by you suggesting a few
convenient times that work with your schedule . i will work with our
management and do my best to schedule one hour time slots for interviews
that fit with your outline .
initially , i will schedule interviews with : ken lay - chairman and ceo ,
jeff skilling - president and coo , and andy fastow - cfo . if you feel that
you may need to speak with additional management , we will definitely try to
work something out the same day , so you don ' t have to travel back here . i
will forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once
the interviews are scheduled . do you anticipate drafting specific
questions ? if so , i would greatly appreciate a copy when convenient .
i greatly look forward to working with you and i hope that we can touch

sounds good ! it will take two or three days for me to strip out , reformat ,

the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have
changed
the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and
logical
security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in
the

a
wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for
information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by

homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing
our
readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this
lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security
happen
with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position
ourselves in

can
also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in
different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a well filling with water .
as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the
entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is
essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives
valuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid
can
also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemical
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .
vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are
more
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technology
application
in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position
vinoble in
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and global spending that the company will require
for
growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is
exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .

tel / fax : + 852 - 301 - 01462
private e - mail : lsong 64 song @ yahoo . com . hk
i am mr . li le song credit officer of the foriegn
operations dept . of the hang seng bank ltd , taikoo shing
branch . i have a obscured business suggestion for
you . before the u . s and iraqi war our client colonel
sadiq uday who was with the iraqi forces and also
business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18
calendar months , with a value of nineteen millions five
hundred thousnd united state dollars only ( usd $ 19 , 5 m ) in
my branch . upon maturity several notice was sent to him ,
even during the war early last year .
again after the war another notification was sent and
still no response came from him . we later find out that
the colonel and his family had been killed during the
war in bomb blast that hit their home . after further
investigation it was also discovered that colonel sadiq
uday did not declare any next of kin in his , official
papers including the paper work of his bank deposit . and
he also confided in me the last time he was at my office
that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank .
so , nineteen millions five hundred thousand united state
dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever
come forward to claim it .
what bothers me most is that according to the laws of my
country at the expiration 4 years the funds will
revert to the ownership of the hong kong government if
nobody applies to claim the funds . against this backdrop ,
my suggestion to you is that i will like you as a
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to colonel sadiq
uday so that you will be able to receive his funds .
what is to be done :
i want you to know that i have had everything planned
out so that we shall come out successful . i have
contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary
document that will back you up as the next of kin to
colonel sadiq uday , all that is required from you at
this stage is for you to provide me with your full names
and address so that the attorney can commence his job .
after you have been made the next of kin , the attorney
will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure
the necessary approval and letter of probate in your
favor for the move of the funds to an account that will
be provided by you . there is no risk involved at all in
the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized
method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary
documents .
please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all
matters concerning this issue . once the funds have been
transferred to your nominated bank account the sharing
ratio is open for negotiation for you . should you be
interested please send me your full names and current
residential address and i will prefers you to reach me
on the email address below ( lsong 64 song @ yahoo . com . hk ) and
finally after that i shall provide you with more details
of this operation .
your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated .

calendar years 2001 - 2005 ( enronoptions  ) your stock option program ) . it is
expected that enronoptions  ) your stock option program will be granted ,
effective on or about december 29 , 2000 , for those employees who are eligible
on that date ( please see note below ) . the new program , which is subject to
final approval by enron  , s board of directors , is as follows :
? enronoptions  ) your stock option program will give stock options to
eligible full - time and part - time regular employees in domestic and
international companies / locations .
? the grant of non - qualified stock options will equal 25 % of annual base
salary ( 5 % of annual base salary for each year of a 5 - year period ) on
december 29 , 2000 . ( salary calculation and value may vary in some
international locations . )
? the board will grant the stock options on december 29 , 2000 .

471,6714,re : transport model,"ken and greg ,
the gamma and cross gamma from our spread option appear to be correct .
one anomaly i found is the price change as function of maturity , see attached
figure .
it is odd , isn ' t it ? and the seeming gamma anomaly is largely because of
this .

zimin ,
i have been looking at the new transport model and there are some returns in
the greek calculations that i am not comfortable with . i have looked through
the formulas and do not see inconsistencies , but we are getting significantly
higher gamma values in ' out years ' than in the ' near months / years ' . rho also
seems to be very high throughout the curve . we are prepared to release this
model to be used on the floor , but would like you to sign off on the
calculations . i know that you have a meeting on this on wednesday , and
wanted to get you the model to review early .
a good example that i am talking about is on the tab "" longterm 9 "" . this is
the kingsgate to malin deal that we worked on previously .
please give me ( or greg couch ) a call with any questions .
thanks .

dear vince
please may i reintroduce myself . we met last year at the sydney eprm
conference which my company kwi sponsored . i chaired the session at which
you spoke .
as you may remember , my company , kwi are one of the world ' s leading
provider
of systems ( kw 3000 ) and consultancy for energy , trading and risk
management .
we have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world ' s leading
energy companies ( not enron unfortunately ) :

- bonneville power
europe
- enel
- atel
- electrabel
- edf
nordic
- vattenfall
- fortum
- sydkraft
- statkraft
- birka energi
- norsk hydro
each year we stage a "" kwi users forum "" - a 2 - day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients . last year there were about 100
delegates . the agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector .
the agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software .
this years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful spanish city of
barcelona and runs from the evening of sunday september 9 th to tuesday
september 11 th . the main conference dinner is on the monday evening and is
always a memorable event . this year it is in a leading barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre - dinner drinks .
i would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address , the
highlight of the conference .
the subject could be :
* a general energy risk related topic
* a general insight into the secret of enron ' s continued success in
the energy markets
* your thoughts on the future development on energy markets ( and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc . ) worldwide
obviously , we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation ,
food and drink .
what ' s in it for you ? many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and i ' m sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views .
please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation .
best regards

482,12997,re : new york,"these are the events that took place concerning the new york customer holiday event :
in order to reserve rooms for the first weekend in ny at the four seasons , i have to book no later than 9 months out .
to hold these rooms , a contract had to be signed and a $ 15 , 000 deposit sent . the contract allowed us to cancel the entire event by the end of july with no penalty and the deposit was fully refundable .
in speaking with dave duran and frank vickers in may , they wanted to proceed with this event . ( attached is a memo that i sent to frank vickers outlining the cancellation policy . )
the cost estimate went through several revisions and the final was sent to you for your approval in july .
after the approval form was rejected , i spoke with dave duran and he was planning to revise his guest list and re - submit the approval form .
i talked to both frank and dave numerous times and reminded them of the hotel penalty issues and had not heard back from either one until i received an e - mail on september 20 th from frank canceling his portion of the trip .
i called my four seasons national sales rep and she is working with ny in canceling the contract and minimizing the hotel liquidated damages . i should have an answer from her no later than tomorrow .
please let me know if you would like to discuss this in more detail .
thanks .

484,11575,term muni deals / prepays,"mike mcdonald and laird dyer are looking at other creditworthy california shorts . some of munis ( roseville , palo alto ) are trying to combine the long term purchase with a muni bond issue in order to prepay for the power . the basic structure is that they borrow money from the tax - exempt market ( 6 % ) , give the proceeds to the power supplier ( who values the money at 7 % + + ) and they effectively get cheaper power .
we have done these deals in the past with nat gas . besides the margin on the commodity , we get cash in the door against an obligation to deliver . given our overall cash targets and ca length , i have made this a priority . mike mcdonald has been selling the concept during the past six months .
we are looking at submitting a notional offer later this week for roseville ( 50 mw - 100 mw , np - 15 , 8 - 10 years ) . the big valuation question relates to ena ' s bid for $ . generally , we have paid over our cost of funds for this cash because it does not show up as debt . in my discussions with joe , he thinks our $ bid should be based on alternative markets for off - balance sheet cash , which might mean libor plus 50 - 150 bp . this sounds reasonable until i think of the fact that i am being charged 15 % for balance sheet funds . the bid / offer for balance sheet cash should not be 7 % xl 5 % .
if i am using $ 100 mm of balance sheet exposure and i can bring in $ 100 mm of cash , shouldn ' t i be able to net out the difference ?
any thoughts ?

498,7024,you are now subscribed to the frbnyrmagl list,"mon , 18 sep 2000 18 : 42 : 47
your subscription to the frbnyrmagl list ( federal reserve bank of ny
research publications ) has been accepted .
please save this message for future reference , especially if this is the
first time you are subscribing to an electronic mailing list . if you ever
need to leave the list , you will find the necessary instructions below .
perhaps more importantly , saving a copy of this message ( and of all
future subscription notices from other mailing lists ) in a special mail
folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you
are subscribed to . this may prove very useful the next time you go on
vacation and need to leave the lists temporarily so as not to fill up
your mailbox while you are away ! you should also save the "" welcome
messages "" from the list owners that you will occasionally receive after
subscribing to a new list .
to send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list ,
just send mail to frbnyrmagl @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . this is called
"" sending mail to the list , "" because you send mail to a single address and
listserv makes copies for all the people who have subscribed . this
address ( frbnyrmagl @ peach . ease . lsoft . com ) is also called the "" list
address . "" you must never try to send any command to that address , as it
would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed . all commands
must be sent to the "" listserv address , "" listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . it
is very important to understand the difference between the two , but
fortunately it is not complicated . the listserv address is like a fax
number that connects you to a machine , whereas the list address is like a
normal voice line connecting you to a person . if you make a mistake and
dial the fax number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone , you
will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again . no
harm will have been done . if on the other hand you accidentally make your
fax call someone ' s voice line , the person receiving the call will be
inconvenienced , especially if your fax then re - dials every 5 minutes . the
fact that most people will eventually connect the fax machine to the
voice line to allow the fax to go through and make the calls stop does
not mean that you should continue to send faxes to the voice number .
people would just get mad at you . it works pretty much the same way with
mailing lists , with the difference that you are calling hundreds or
thousands of people at the same time , and consequently you can expect a
lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list
address .
you may leave the list at any time by sending a "" signoff frbnyrmagl ""
command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can also tell listserv how
you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list . if
you do not trust the system , send a "" set frbnyrmagl repro "" command and
listserv will send you a copy of your own messages , so that you can see
that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way .
after a while you may find that this is getting annoying , especially if
your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it
informs you that new mail has arrived from frbnyrmagl . if you send a "" set
frbnyrmagl ack norepro "" command , listserv will mail you a short
acknowledgement instead , which will look different in your mailbox
directory . with most mail programs you will know immediately that this is
an acknowledgement you can read later . finally , you can turn off
acknowledgements completely with "" set frbnyrmagl noack norepro "" .
contributions sent to this list are automatically archived . you can get a
list of the available archive files by sending an "" index frbnyrmagl ""
command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can then order these files
with a "" get frbnyrmagl logxxxx "" command , or using listserv ' s database
search facilities . send an "" info database "" command for more information
on the latter .
important : this list is confidential . you should not publicly mention its
existence , or forward copies of information you have obtained from it to
third parties . please note that the "" give "" command is automatically
disabled for all archive files .
more information on listserv commands can be found in the listserv
reference card , which you can retrieve by sending an "" info refcard ""
command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com .",ham,2000-09-18

watches , clocks and alarm clocks manufactured in switzerland bear the designation - swiss made - ( or its abbreviation swiss ) as well as the logo of the producer or distributor . this label enjoys a solid reputation throughout the world .
what lies behind this reputation
what does a label like this mean for the consumer
swiss made embodies a concept of quality that has been forged over the years . it includes the technical quality of watches ( accuracy , reliability , water - resistance and shock - resistance ) , as well as their aesthetic quality ( elegance and originality of design ) . it covers both traditional manufacturing and new technologies ( micro - electronics ) .
the swiss are not the only watchmakers to manufacture high - quality timepieces and are consequently faced with strong competition . however , thanks to their unique infrastructure and to their know - how and spirit of innovation , they have succeeded in maintaining their leading position .
the intrinsic value of the swiss made label , therefore , is the result of considerable efforts on the part of watchmaking companies , who are ultimately responsible for maintaining its reputation .

strictly confidential .
attention : director ,
you may be surprised to receive this message from me since you don ' t know me in person , but for the purpose of introduction , i am steve williams , the son of late mr . michael williams , who was murdered in a land dispute in zimbabwe .
you contact was given to me at the south africa exchange network on line here in johannesburg as reliable and trustworthy to deal with , and then i decided to write you . my late father was among the few black zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for zimbabwean opposition party . which we communicated to the whole world through bbc and cnn .
before the death of my father , he took me to south africa to deposit the sum of twenty million us dollars ( $ 20 m ) with a security and finance company , as if he knew the looming danger in zimbabwe . the money was deposited as a gem or precious stone to avoid much demurrage from the security firm . this money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland .
this land problem arose when president r . mugabe introduced a new land act . which wholly affects the white rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the ' modus operandi ' adopted by the government . this resulted to rampant killing and mob actions . i and my family who are currently staying in south africa as a refugee or an asylum seeker have decided to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can invest it . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have the same political history . moreover , the south african monetary policy / law does not allow such investment hence i am seeking for an asylum or refugee .
i must let you know that this business is 100 % risk free and the nature of your business does not necessary matter . so if you are willing to assist us , i and my family have agreed to give you 20 % of the total money , 40 % will be for a joint business venture i will be doing with you and another 35 % will be for me and my family which we shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5 % will be mapped out for all expenses we may incurred during the transaction .
therefore , if you are willing and interested to render the needed assistance , endeavour to reply through the above tel / fax no . i also need your private phone and fax number for easy communication . remember that this is highly confidential and the success of this business depends on how secret it is kept .
expecting your reply soonest .
best regards .
mr steve williams

happy new year all ,
i have been with enron for over 16 years and i have made some very good friends during my time here and right now i am feeling their pain and panic . i talk to several of my terminated friends ( and sister ) each week and get updates from them on what is going on outside of enron . i just want to do whatever i can to help them get through these hard times , this is the reason for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for them .
i passed on the phone numbers for towers perrin and other numbers that they need to get their money from the cash balance plan or to find out more about the cobra benefits , etc . but there is a major stumbling block in their way right now . they keep being told that no one can do anything for them , not even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these benefits , because enron has not changed their status from active to terminated ( or inactive ) . how can it possibly take a month to get this status changed ? please realize that a lot of these people have nothing : no paycheck coming in , no unemployment checks yet , no retirement , no cash balance money , no medical benefits . . . . they are feeling scared and panicked . . . . please lets do something to help them . i have no clue what all it takes to get 4 , 500 + employees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish this . whomever is in charge of getting this done , are we sure they have a sense of urgency about the situation ? people could lose their homes , cars , etc . while they are waiting on all this red tape . . . . this is very important .
please advise .

c . 2001 new york times company
earlier this year , most companies would have loved to have enron ' s problems . californians resented the energy trading company ' s huge profits during their energy crisis , and democrats in washington raised questions about enron ' s influence within the white house and about the cozy relationship between enron ' s chairman , kenneth lay , and vice president dick cheney . nobody seemed better positioned to thrive during the bush presidency than this houston - based apostle of deregulation .
wall street was impressed with enron ' s strategy of swooping into formerly regulated markets to broker contracts for natural gas , electricity or unused telecom bandwidth . the company was celebrated as a paragon of american ingenuity , a stodgy gas pipeline company that had reinvented itself as a high - tech clearinghouse in an ever - expanding roster of markets . enron ' s push to force utilities into the internet age with its online trading systems , at a seemingly handsome profit , became an epic tale of the dot - com revolution .
it now appears that enron ' s tale may be more cautionary than epic . enron envy has crashed , along with the company ' s stock price , as serious questions emerge about its bookkeeping . enron disclosed earlier this month that $ 1 . 2 billion in market value had vanished as a result of a controversial deal it entered into with private partnerships run by its chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
most alarming was enron ' s reluctance to shed light on management ' s wheeling and dealing . ' ' related - party transactions , ' ' as the accountants call them , are fraught with conflicts of interest . though much remains to be learned about these transactions , their scope and lack of transparency suggest that enron may have in effect created its own private hedge fund to assume some of the risk and mask the losses of its complex trading . the extent to which company insiders profited from the partnerships is not yet clear .
enron has scrambled to dampen wall street ' s concerns , acknowledging its credibility problem while insisting on the health of its core businesses . on wednesday it brought in william powers , the dean of the university of texas school of law , to review the transactions . the securities and exchange commission has launched its own formal investigation . mr . fastow was forced to resign , following jeffrey skilling , the man credited with driving enron into new cutting - edge businesses , out the door .
enron ' s former admirers on wall street , mindful of recent scandals involving high - profile companies doctoring their earnings , and of the spectacular collapse of the long - term capital management hedge fund in 1998 , are alarmed . carole coale of prudential securities summed up the prevailing sentiment when she told the times : ' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose facts . ' ' analysts , as well as the media , are not entirely blameless . enron did mention , albeit in passing , the troubling related - party deals as early as march 2000 . but few analysts bothered to raise questions at a time when the company ' s revenues , profits and stock price were soaring .
harvey pitt , the new securities and exchange commissioner , must pursue the enron inquiry aggressively in order to assure investors that he will be as vigilant as his predecessor , arthur levitt , when it comes to protecting the integrity of financial markets . indeed , even if enron is cleared of any wrongdoing and regains some of its past luster , as it well might , the company that preaches the merits of self - regulating marketplaces has reminded us all of the need for a strong regulator on wall street .

the enron debacle
byzantine deals have shattered the energy outfit ' s credibility
executives at high - flying enron corp . ( ene ) never seemed overly concerned with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices . earlier this year , the california attorney general had to get a court order to collect documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing . and when an analyst challenged former ceo jeffrey k . skilling in a conference call to produce enron ' s balance sheet , skilling called him an "" ass - - - - . "" still , even some enron executives worried that the company had gone too far with two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge investments . with enron ' s then - chief financial officer acting as general manager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their investments , the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from investors seemed overwhelming . "" internally , everybody said this is not a good idea , "" says a source close to the company .
but no one could have predicted such a jaw - dropping outcome for the nation ' s largest and most innovative energy trader . since oct . 16 , when enron revealed a $ 35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnerships and was forced to knock $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholders ' equity , the company ' s stock has plunged 60 % . the securities its highly ballyhooed business for trading high - speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom industry meltdown ; and its calamitous foray into the water business with azurix corp . has already cost enron at least $ 574 million in write - offs .
these bad bets and the expensive ljm shock have investors worried about what else might be lurking at enron . many aren ' t sticking around to find out . "" i think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the credibility of the management team , "" says richard a . giesen , who manages the munder power plus fund , which dumped its enron shares about a month ago .
it ' s not clear just how many off - balance - sheet financing vehicles enron has used over time . some were created years ago to finance oil and gas producers . analysts and sources close to the deals say there ' s no particular risk in these to enron shareholders . other interconnected entities , such as whitewing , osprey , atlantic water trust , and marlin water trust , were a way to get assets no longer central to enron ' s strategy off its balance sheet , freeing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broadband ( table ) .
to entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into these deals , enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren ' t enough to cover debt . such "" mandatory equity "" deals have been used by at least a half - dozen others in the energy and telecom industries , including el paso ( epg ) , williams , and dominion , says standard & poor ' s director todd a . shipman . "" nobody ' s going to find anything that ' s particularly unique or below board "" in such deals , says one investment banker specializing in the energy business .
worst case , which shipman considers unlikely , enron could be on the hook for about $ 3 billion in its mandatory - equity deals . that could mean diluting its shares by more than 25 % at today ' s prices . analyst john e . olson at sanders morris harris inc . ( smhg ) figures a 9 % dilution is more likely . even if this $ 3 billion in debt were included on enron ' s balance sheet now , the debt - to - capital ratio would climb to 54 % from about 49 % at the end of june . such a change would pressure enron ' s credit rating but not push it below investment grade , says shipman .
huge hit . fastow ' s ljm , a private equity fund , was a different kind of animal , according to sources familiar with the arrangements . it bought energy and other assets from enron , which booked gains and losses on those deals . ljm was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the volatility of some of enron ' s investments , including stakes in high - tech and telecom businesses and an interest in new power co . , which markets power to consumers . when enron terminated these deals in september , it took the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity .
but the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with the company . the first place that might show up is in enron ' s highly successful online platform , which trades everything from gas and electricity to weather derivatives . to reassure its partners , enron is scrambling to shore up its liquidity . it has already tapped $ 3 billion in credit lines and is trying to arrange another $ 1 billion . shipman says he has seen no signs of massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms . still , rival traders are wary . "" we certainly have taken a closer look at enron in the last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk , but we ' re still doing business with the company as usual , "" says keith g . stamm , ceo of power and gas trader aquila inc . ( ila )
"" speeding train . "" still , with the stock battered and rating agencies considering further downgrades , that could rapidly change . in recent days , the uncertainty about enron ' s future has reduced investors ' appetite for enron debt . "" no one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of survival , "" says a credit - derivatives salesperson . "" it ' s really difficult to get in front of a speeding train . ""
even if lay can calm his trading partners , he and his management team face a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on wall street . with the stock now hovering around $ 14 - - down from a high of $ 90 in august , 2000 - - some even believe that enron could be a takeover target for the likes of ge capital or royal dutch / shell group . ( rd ) both declined to comment . would enron sell ? one source close to the company says enron has talked about possible mergers and strategic alliances in the past with royal dutch / shell , among others . "" if they ' re really worried about liquidity , they might take the easy way out , "" he says .
if enron does pull through this crisis , some suspect it will be a humbler , more risk - averse place . the company that once believed it could expand its trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities - - from advertising space to steel - - will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions . that ' s something some investors applaud . "" the company should focus on its strengths , "" says william n . adams , senior energy analyst at banc of america capital management , a major shareholder . but that ' s a far less exciting place than enron ' s energy cowboys ever hoped to roam .

derivatives danger ?
lately , owners of enron ' s ( ene ) equity , bonds , and loans have been struggling to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they didn ' t know about before . now , as a fuller picture of enron ' s entanglements with partnerships begins to emerge , investors have something else to worry about : credit default swaps , known as cdss for short .
that ' s financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans . their owners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they have if their investments go bad . the cds market has existed only for about two years , but it ' s growing fast . goldman , sachs & co . ( gs ) and others estimate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $ 1 trillion and $ 1 . 5 trillion are covered . not surprisingly , big banks with hefty balance sheets such as j . p . morgan chase ( jpm ) , merrill lynch ( mer ) , and deutsche bank ( db ) dominate the market .
enron , however , is a player - - and the only significant one that isn ' t also a bank . competitors say that although enron has issued only between $ 500 million and $ 700 million worth of cdss so far this year , it had ambitious plans to offer them online . "" they don ' t belong in this market , "" says one trader . "" they don ' t understand the implications . "" enron did not return calls seeking comment .
of course , neither enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans and bonds they ' re insuring turn bad . trouble is , this year is potentially a doozie for losses on corporate debt . corporate defaults could reach a record of $ 100 billion , says standard & poor ' s , like businessweek a unit of the mcgraw - hill companies . regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $ 193 billion by early october .
if enron has insured any of the bad debt , it might have to take charges for losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting . with all that has been happening in recent weeks , that ' s the last thing it needs .

commentary : enron ' s clout won ' t sway the sec
for securities & exchange commission chairman harvey l . pitt , the sec ' s investigation into enron corp . ( ene ) could hardly have come at a worse time . the future of pitt ' s ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation could depend on how well he handles this case .
enron ' s political clout and close ties to president george w . bush create real risks for the sec . enron ceo kenneth l . lay is a longtime bush backer , and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the president ' s campaign . a bush appointee , pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act . he has made it clear he wants to speed up the sec ' s enforcement , in part by rewarding companies that cooperate with probes . but he insists the sec will still come down hard on true corporate miscreants - - and knows that any signs of let - up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda .
enter the enron probe . the fine shadings of securities enforcement - - where most cases are settled by negotiated penalties , not court - imposed fines - - often make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the sec is being tough or lenient . but pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the enron case is handled by the book - - getting the same strict scrutiny from the sec as any other , less connected company .
for now , top sec aides say that ' s happening . the sec enforcement div . in washington is looking into whether enron adequately disclosed to shareholders the risks of its complex deals with andrew s . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer . agency insiders say pitt and his fellow commissioners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds . but they insist pitt hasn ' t heard from the white house or enron ' s other political allies .
top lobbyist . enron ' s connections are numerous . besides lay ' s links to bush , an enron director , wendy lee gramm , is the wife of texas senator phil gramm , top republican on the senate banking committee . and enron spreads its lobbying budget - - $ 2 . 13 million in 2000 - - across both parties . just this year it hired four lobbying firms with democratic roots . enron says it lobbies heavily because it operates in regulated industries . it notes that electric utilities outspend it 35 to 1 .
on oct . 31 , a special committee of enron ' s board hired william r . mclucas , former sec enforcement director , to represent it . mclucas should know that any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire . pitt , who joined the sec out of law school in 1968 , "" remembers how the [ nixon - era ] sec tainted itself by turning a blind eye to [ fugitive financier ] robert vesco , "" says an agency veteran . pitt has too much riding on the enron probe to let its connections sway his judgment .

afl - cio , amalgamated bank call on enron to redirect the mission of newly created special committee : outside directors must adopt independent role

washington , nov . 2 / prnewswire / - - in a shareholder letter sent today to the board of directors of the enron corporation ( nyse : ene ) , the afl - cio and the amalgamated bank called on enron to expand the mission of its newly created special committee and for enron ' s board to adopt a package of reforms designed to restore investor confidence in the battered energy firm . america ' s working families are significant shareholders of enron stock through their pension , health and welfare benefit funds .
among other suggestions , the letter urges the board to expand the special committee ' s mandate to : * examine all transactions with entities in which enron employees
or directors have an interest
* adopt procedures for reviewing insider participation in investments
* commence an extraordinary review of executive compensation
* adopt a stricter definition of director independence and disclose
director conflicts of interest
"" the special committee ' s mandate is far too narrow to address the current crisis , "" said richard trumka , secretary - treasurer of the afl - cio . "" in light of enron ' s recent balance sheet write - downs , share price decline , and credit rating deterioration , the special committee must be forward looking and consider sweeping governance reform measures , "" he explained .
"" in this time of crisis , outside directors must reform enron ' s traditional lack of transparency and communicate directly with shareholders , "" said gabriel caprio , president and ceo of the amalgamated bank . "" this is particularly important since several outside directors have apparent conflicts of interest that compromise their objectivity , "" he added .
afl - cio affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds with over $ 400 billion in assets and hold an estimated 3 . 1 million enron shares . the afl - cio is joined in its call for reform by the amalgamated bank , the trustee of the longview funds which hold 251 , 304 shares of enron . the amalgamated bank ' s longview funds are collective investment trusts that manage equity assets on behalf of workers ' benefit funds .

williams ceo sees validation of co ' s bandwidth model
11 / 02 / 2001
dow jones energy service
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
houston - ( dow jones ) - at the beginning of the year , two telecommunications units born of energy companies seemed to symbolize the different ways to sell bandwidth .
enron corp . ( ene ) was viewed as the hot pioneer blazing a trail for selling telecommunications network capacity as a commodity like natural gas or electricity .
on the other hand , williams communications group ( wcg ) seemed to promote the old - fashioned method that telecommunications companies have used for making long - term agreements .
on thursday , wcg reported third - quarter earnings of $ 22 . 6 million before taxes and interest . wcg chairman and chief executive howard janzen told dow jones newswires that the earnings validated williams ' model of a bandwidth company being a provider of services , not a trader of commodities .
"" i think bandwidth trading has its place , "" janzen said . "" it ' s developing relatively slowly . the reality is ( that ) bandwidth is not a commodity except for lower - capacity services and on certain routes with large amounts of capacity . ""
enron reported an $ 80 million third - quarter loss for its broadband services unit .
as janzen views it , bandwidth is defined by the technology used to provide it .
"" the bandwidth we ' ll sell five years from now will be different from what we ' re selling today because of changes in technology , "" he said .
after taxes and interest , williams reported a loss of $ 272 . 7 million on revenue of $ 297 . 8 million in the third quarter . an extraordinary gain of $ 223 . 7 million from the repurchase of senior redeemable notes in the open market enabled williams to post the positive result before taxes and interest .
in the same period a year ago , williams reported a net loss of $ 150 . 5 million on revenue of $ 209 million .
williams also announced thursday that it has agreed to buy the assets of coreexpress , a company which operated on williams ' network . coreexpress guarantees data delivery over multiple networks and developed software to monitor quality of service over multiple networks .
terms of the agreement weren ' t disclosed . the deal won ' t close until undisclosed conditions are met .
williams also announced a 20 - year agreement valued at $ 267 million to provide bandwidth to boeing co .

usa : enron shares plunge after s & p credit rating cut .
11 / 02 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 2 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . dropped more than 8 percent in early trade on friday , as the stock took a new plunge in a two - week free - fall , a day after its credit rating was cut for the second time this week .
enron was down 89 cents , or 7 . 4 percent , to $ 11 . 10 on the new york stock exchange , after briefly slipping to $ 10 . 95 , a price it also touched briefly on tuesday and last closed at in july 1992 .
enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , lined up $ 1 billion of new credit on thursday in a bid to restore investor confidence . even so , standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating after stock markets closed on thursday , saying it could do so again if the situation worsens .
enron has been rocked by a stock slide that has slashed two - thirds of its share price since oct . 16 , when the company reported a $ 1 billion charge that was caused , in part , by dealings linked to a chief financial officer who was subsequently ousted .
houston - based enron is facing an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission into those dealings . at issue are off - balance sheet deals with limited partnerships , run by then - cfo andrew fastow , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity .

goldman declines enron ' s request for loan amid credit concerns
2001 - 11 - 02 11 : 22 ( new york )
goldman declines enron ' s request for loan amid credit concerns
new york , nov . 2 ( bloomberg ) - - goldman sachs group inc .
refused to participate in a $ 1 billion loan to enron corp . because
it was unwilling to risk its capital on a client with falling
credit ratings that has been using its investment - banking services
less often , according to people familiar with matter .
enron chief executive kenneth lay asked for the line of
credit after meeting with bankers from goldman , j . p . morgan chase
& co . and citigroup inc . last month to discuss ways to alleviate a
cash crunch . j . p . morgan and citigroup agreed to lend on the
condition that the houston - based energy trader pledge two
pipelines as collateral .
goldman ' s refusal highlights its reluctance to provide credit
lines to all but its top fee - paying clients . by not lending to
enron , the firm also is able to advise companies that want to buy
enron or some of its assets , or make a bid of its own .
for enron , the decision makes it harder to resist the demands
of its existing lenders , who made the company give up collateral
and pay higher interest rates to get its new loan .
` ` people smell resistance to enron , ' ' said glenn reynolds , an
analyst with creditsights . com , an independent research firm . ` ` the
balance of power is the with the banks now . ' '
kathleen baum , a spokeswoman for goldman , said the firm had
` ` a long history of putting its capital to work for clients . ' ' she
wouldn ' t comment on the firm ' s relationship with enron . karen
denne , a spokeswoman for enron , said , ` ` i won ' t confirm who we
have had talks with . ' '
shut out
enron needed the $ 1 billion secured loan to supplement cash
reserves and help the company pay off existing debt . yesterday ,
standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s long - term credit rating to ` ` bbb , ' '
the second - lowest investment grade rating , from ` ` bbb + . ' '
the sec is investigating partnerships run by former chief
financial officer andrew fastow that bought and sold enron shares
and assets . those trades cost enron $ 35 million . the company also
lost $ 1 . 2 billion in shareholder equity .
enron ' s dealings with the partnerships have shut it out of
commercial - paper markets , where corporations borrow money for days
or weeks . lenders are concerned that the company may have further
losses from its trading business .
a week ago enron tapped $ 3 billion in credit lines , arranged
by j . p . morgan and citibank , to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial
paper it has outstanding .
already loaded down with enron debt , j . p . morgan and citibank
forced enron to pay as much as 2 . 5 percentage points more than the
london interbank offered rate , or libor , on its new loan ,
according to the people familiar with the matter . that ' s about
five times the spread enron is paying on its existing lines ,
according to bloomberg data .
the extra yield wasn ' t sufficient incentive for goldman to
lend . securities firms such as goldman are required to value
lending commitments at market prices , exposing them to potential
losses from declines in loan prices . banks such as j . p . morgan and
citibank are allowed to carry the assets at full value .
falling prices
enron ' s existing loans have already fallen to between 80 and
90 cents on the dollar since the company drew them down , according
to traders .
the company ' s 6 . 4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as
much as 6 cents on the dollar today , with price indications
between 68 and 73 cents , traders said . yesterday , traders bid for
the bonds at 74 cents and offered to sell them at 77 cents
goldman has been getting less investment - banking business
from enron .
the no . 3 u . s . securities firm by capital hasn ' t arranged a
bond sale for enron since 1995 , and enron hasn ' t picked goldman to
advise on an acquisition or sale since at least 1993 , according to
bloomberg data . the firm is a dealer on enron ' s $ 3 billion
commercial paper program and has arranged six of the company ' s 15
preferred share sales .
without a steady flow of investment banking fees , goldman is
reluctant to make loans that tie up capital in a business that is
less profitable than advising on mergers or underwriting
securities .
among clients the firm has turned down : ford motor co . , the
second - largest automaker , and vodafone group plc , europe ' s largest
cellular phone company .
goldman did extend $ 2 billion in credit to at & t corp . as part
of a $ 25 billion credit facility last year . the largest u . s . long -
distance phone company is one of the firm ' s most lucrative
clients , however , paying out more than $ 100 million in investment -
banking fees during the past five years .
after refusing to lend to enron , goldman is unlikely to
advise the energy trader on any of its planned $ 2 . 1 billion in
asset sales , the people familiar said .
j . p . morgan is advising enron on the sale of its azurix north
american water business and may be retained , along with
citigroup ' s salomon smith barney unit , to look at other disposals
and a possible sale of the whole company , the people said .
goldman , which has an energy trading business of its own , may
already be advising potential buyers of enron ' s businesses , or
lining up a bid of its own , reynolds said .
` ` we may well see goldman pop up on the other side , which
would explain its reticence to lend , ' ' he said .
power points : time for a bronx miracle in houston
by mark golden
11 / 02 / 2001
dow jones energy service
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
a dow jones newswires column
new york - ( dow jones ) - with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by two runs with one man on , enron corp . ( ene ) needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game .
this is the home run enron must come up with : full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet , and proof the corporation can cover the difference . it ' s what stockholders , bondholders and trading partners have been demanding , but time is running out , and enron hasn ' t produced .
"" we ' re going to get to that number soon and tell people . we have to do that , "" said a source at enron , who didn ' t know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited . "" in this environment , we are going to be absolutely sure that it ' s accurate . ""
enron has about $ 3 . 3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in 2003 . the company will sell the assets in those partnerships and , in a worse case scenario , will face a $ 1 billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets , enron has said . the company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock , shares will be trading closer to $ 20 than their current $ 11 .
investors , however , aren ' t acting as if they ' re reassured . part of the trouble , analysts with credit - rating firm standard & poor ' s said friday morning , is that until enron sells the assets , nobody knows for sure what they ' re worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole .
s & p is confident that enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole , provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company .
credit derivative fizzle
to see the pickle the world ' s premier energy franchise is in , one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk . that relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely , but the desk hasn ' t been able to transact for three weeks , since the value of enron ' s stock and bonds began to plummet , according to another enron employee .
enron didn ' t respond to a request for comment , but the enron credit division in europe said in a release that lines are "" constrained "" as the market continues to evaluate the company ' s credit position .
until recently , customers would buy a credit derivative from enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company . a big supplier to a financially troubled company like xerox corp . ( xrx ) or lucent technologies ( lu ) , for example , might pay enron $ 1 million a year for a payout of , say , $ 10 million in the event of a bankruptcy .
but you wouldn ' t pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims . likewise , with enron ' s creditworthiness in doubt , there ' s no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange lucent risk for enron risk .
the same holds true , though less obviously , for enron ' s core business of energy trading . some utilities , large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - already on the rise at $ 3 per million british thermal units - shoot to $ 10 this winter as they did last winter .
to guard against that risk , companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices . if a company wants to lock in winter gas at $ 3 , should it turn to enron ? if gas were to rise to $ 10 in january and enron couldn ' t deliver , enron ' s counterparty paid a good price for no protection . and if enron failed in a $ 10 gas market , that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies . gas could go to $ 20 in a heartbeat .
leading role an asset
enron does have a man on base . the company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want enron to survive . and any company that moves to lock enron out of the market now could regret doing so if enron survives as the big dog .
enron ' s trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point : they are continuing to trade with enron , but are avoiding long - term deals that increase their exposure to the company . the only acceptable long - term deals are those that offset deals done earlier . unless and until a bill goes unpaid , they ' ll keep delivering .
enron , like the rest of the u . s . energy industry , paid its bills for september gas deliveries on oct . 20 and for its september electricity deliveries on oct . 25 . its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of november .
that means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before enron ' s creditworthiness faces another test . in exchange for taking on that small risk , they keep the great market maker in business .
lenders show concerns
lenders , whether through holding enron bonds or providing loans , don ' t have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash . lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time , usually years .
outside of long - term commitments , what worries the banks , which presumably got a good look at enron ' s books ? if enron is now unable to make the big bets with long - term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years , can it service all of its liabilities , known and unknown ? if it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants , or otherwise put those assets at risk , will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs ? what happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsewhere ?
if enron is to have a chance , it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt . so far this year , trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for $ 2 . 2 billion out of $ 2 . 4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes . by comparison , enron has made $ 617 million in interest payments so far this year .

enron says it remains ' biggest ' player in eu gas , power

( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
london - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ( ene ) said in a statement friday that it remains the "" the biggest buyer and seller of gas and power in europe , "" and that its enrononline platform "" continues to be the key trading platform in europe . ""
the company issued the statement in response to widespread rumors that several companies have ceased trading gas and power with enron since its share price took a nosedive last week .
in the statement , enron added that worldwide transactions in the power and gas markets were averaging $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion a day , up from a 30 - day average of $ 2 . 5 billion at close of business friday , oct . 26 .
enron has been on the defensive after announcing a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million two weeks ago , followed by news that it took a $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down , based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers .
on wednesday , enron disclosed that the sec elevated its inquiry into enron ' s alleged related - party transactions to a formal probe .
enron corp . secured $ 1 billion in new credit lines this week , but the deal did not appease credit - rating agency standard + 44 - ( 0 ) 20 - 7842 - 9345 ; sarah . spikes @ dowjones . com

usa : update 1 - enron shares fall as investor concerns linger .
by janet mcgurty
11 / 02 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 2 ( reuters ) - shares in enron corp . , the u . s . energy trading giant facing a federal probe into its dealings , declined on friday amid lingering investor concern about management credibility and the outcome of pending lawsuits .
shares of enron were off 62 cents , or 5 . 2 percent , at $ 11 . 37 in early afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , recouping some losses after plunging briefly to $ 10 . 95 , a closing price last seen in july 1992 and touched in intraday trade on tuesday .
enron debt due in 2006 declined about another 6 points , and was trading at about 65 cents on the dollar . the bonds were trading at about $ 1 . 01 two weeks ago , before enron announced on oct . 16 a $ 1 billion charge , caused in part by dealings linked to partnerships run until recently by a chief financial officer who was ousted last week , and that form part of the federal probe .
"" there remain several fundamental issues that we believe need to be addressed before the clouds can clear above enron ' s skies , "" said ronald barone of brokerage ubs warburg .
apart from the probe by the securities and exchange commission , barone said concerns include "" the evolving state of the company ' s balance sheet , management credibility and ultimate outcome of shareholder lawsuits . ""
a handful of law firms have sued enron , saying it overstated operating results , failed to write down assets on a timely basis and concealed investments that might require the company to issue large amounts of shares to cover loses .
enron ' s woes have put it under intense investor scrutiny , with the company losing about $ 17 billion in market capitalization in the past two weeks . the afl - cio union umbrella urged enron on friday to review executive compensation and adopt procedures for insider investments , among other recommendations .
afl - cio affiliate unions sponsor benefit funds that hold an estimated 3 . 1 million enron shares .
premium player in risk management
shares also plunged on friday - they have fallen about two - thirds in the past two weeks - after standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating late thursday , the second cut this week .
although s & p said another rate cut could ensue if enron ' s situation worsens , a team of s & p analysts told investors on a conference call on friday they were confident they were aware of all the company ' s financial obligations .
enron has been criticized for providing scant details about its dealings , leading to concerns about the riskiness of its obligations .
"" enron is a premium player in the risk management area , "" said ronald barone , a member of the s & p team who is not related to ubs ' s barone .
the s & p analysts said they were using about $ 1 . 5 billion as the amount of off - balance sheet items , about half the $ 3 billion calculated in past years , because of a change in reporting international energy assets , which no longer puts non - recourse debt onto the balance sheet in places like india and south america .
the s & p analysts also said they felt enron ' s move to secure a $ 1 billion line of additional credit earlier this week sent out enron ' s clear commitment to credit quality .
they also said it seemed reasonable to expect a long - term solution to fix enron ' s hard to understand balance sheet would assume an infusion of long - term equity as well as asset sales .
the s & p ratings team also said it was closely monitoring enron ' s trading partners for a change in their credit stance toward enron and , to date , have seen no significant change .
but they cautioned that could change at any time and that was the reason for putting enron on the credit watch listing .
enron chairman and chief executive officer ken lay , who has been criticized for not providing the public enough details on enron , was a no - show at a business conference in houston where he had been scheduled to speak on friday morning .
enron executive robert bradley , who declined to respond to questions from reuters after his speech , said he had been sent to replace lay because "" ken is better at putting out fires at enron . ""

jay webb is also supportive of this . when he and i agreed that savita reporting to him was taking him away from a large , complex development job , he said brad should take the role . jay works well with brad and thinks brad , with time , will work well in andy zipper ' s old role . jay also signed a new contract recently and is committed to leading all technical and operational issues for enrononline and will be working closely with brad and savita .

subject : management conference - business unit panel
hello all ,
i ' m planning the agenda for this year ' s management conference . i ' ve been working on the upcoming meeting since march , but as you can imagine , the direction has changed several times .
we are delighted to have general norman schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership , and gary hamel returning to help us process the past year . while we have arranged an all - star line up of outside speakers , we also want to focus on what is happening inside enron . rather than having only one or two business presentations , mark frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate .
currently , the panel is scheduled to take place 8 : 00 - 9 : 30 am on friday , november 16 . please plan to present a very high level overview of your business . you are welcome to use powerpoint slides , but in the interest of time , presentations must be no more than 10 minutes . mark will introduce each of you , interject questions , encourage interaction , and ensure we stay on time .
below is the proposed order for your presentations . regardless of your place in the rundown , you will need to be seated on stage by 7 : 50 am and equipped with a microphone . because we have a full agenda that morning , we will try to begin the session promptly at 8 : 00 am .
stan horton - global services
louise kitchen - americas
john sherriff - europe
mike mcconnell - global markets
jeff mcmahon - industrial markets
janet dietrich - retail
if you elect to use a powerpoint presentation , please forward it to me electronically by friday , november 9 or provide the presentation to me on cd at the management conference . to ensure consistancy , i ' ve attached a powerpoint template that i would like you to use .
>
finally , mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4 : 00 pm on wednesday , november 14 following your arrival at the management conference . the meeting will take place in the library off the main lobby of the westin la cantera . in the meantime , if you have any questions or need any assistance , please contact me . i look forward to working with you .
regards ,

agency does not expect el nino and la nina to affect global weather for the
next nine months . the two weather patterns , which occur because of changes
in ocean temperatures in the pacific ocean , directly influence us rain
patterns and land temperatures . the cpc says this winter will be the first
year in three that the us has not had a strong influence from this
particular climate - driving force . but , that does not mean there will be a
whole lot of difference in terms of when winter will start . it will have
something to do with temperatures , because both la nina and el nino have
tended to make temperatures moderate in the winter . ? the cpc expects that
this winter nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal ,
but not as warm as the last three . the northern part of the nation and
particularly the northeast , however , could be an exception with colder
weather . the warmer pattern will be confined more to the west and the south .
east of the mississippi with the exception of florida should be cooler this
winter and most of california and the northern half of the rockies and the
dakotas . for the fall and winter , expect the southwest to be the mild and

subject : webmodal
at monday ' s egm meeting , mike mcconnell asked me to describe the webmodal
acquisition egm made last week . following is a brief description of the
freight capacity market and what webmodal gets us :
market
the us market for logistics is $ 600 bn annually . we are pursuing the largest
homogenous segment which is long - haul truckload and intermodal . that market
is $ 50 - $ 100 bn annually , depending on who you ask and whether you include
dedicated fleets .
the interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely
fragmented and massively intermediated . there are over 100 , 000 trucking
companies ( carriers ) in the us and thousands of independent brokers ( brokers
in this market act as credit principals ) . 10 - 20 % of all loads are conducted
in the spot market ( brokered ) and the rest are done under 1 - 3 year contracts
that are generally non - firm , but define the relationship between each shipper
and their chosen carriers or intermediaries .
on the rail side , the us railroads act as wholesalers , selling their capacity
to intermodal marketing companies ( imcs ) . the imcs then retail or broker out
that capacity to shippers . the difficult part of ground intermodal is that
the rail haul makes up only the long - haul component . the trip from the
origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the
destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck .
this first and last mile transportation is called "" drayage "" .
webmodal
webmodal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they
look identical to truck . they have a database with prices and schedules from
all the rrs and 48 drayage companies that gives them complete us coverage . a
buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive
instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service .
because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail
and truck , the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is
significant . for any move greater than 500 miles , intermodal is generally
20 - 30 % less expensive than a single driver truck move . the substitutability
of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price .
the webmodal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise
and a good head start as we enter this market . the next move will be to
build a truck intermediation capability .
i encourage you to meet chris kravas the ceo of webmodal . he will be
spending all of his time in houston when he is not on the road .
please give me a call if you have any questions .
thanks ,

subject : re : revised language
good point , but i ' m comfortable we ' re covered because our bidders were all
bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points . they are deemed to be on
notice that they had alternate point rights ( its in the tariff ) and if they
wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and
alternates , they could have done so . none of them did , and most importantly ,
the winning bidders did not . our letter agreement simply memorializes that
we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or
alternates . i assume from your message you are ok with this and they can get
it nailed down ? df

subject : re : revised language
i just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in
the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that
the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed
to . my concern with adding the language below is , could it be argued that
not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point , since we just
stated topack and needles and if they knew they might have bid a different
rate ? ?

625,28216,monday staff meeting,"guys - weather permitting in the texas panhandle area , i expect to be in
friona , tx on monday , november 20 th , on business . provided below are some
items i would have mentioned in the monday staff meeting :
plains farmer ' s coop - to date , i have been able to collect approximately
half of the $ 500 , 000 imbalance which plains coop owes tw . i will be meeting
charles hough in friona ( friona is located 100 miles west of amarillo ) on
monday to discuss the payment plan for the remaining imbalance amount in
additionai to other general business matters . i discussed my action plan
with legal and credit and will request full payment by january 31 , 2000 ,
latest date . effective febrary lst , tw will also include penalty payments
with any future imbalance outside the + / - 10 % tolerance level .
pogo producing - i met recently with john havard with pogo . pogo plans to
spud a well in eddy county which is an offset to the eog operated well
recently completed and in the process of being attached to tw . pogo ' s well
will be spud in december with an expected 60 day drill & completion time .
they have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the eog
well - current initial production of 14 mmcf / d , and have plans for additional
drilling in the field area .
cig - a conference call was held with cig on friday to discuss delivery
performance issues of deliveries to the cig / tumbleweed point and the ability
of them to increase their delivery capacity to transwestern . they
explained that cig is currently fully subscribed and operating at maop along
the line which provides deliveries to transwestern , el paso , nng and
sps / nichols . all shippers holding capacity along this line ( capacity 200
mmcf / d ) already have subscribed to long term contracts primarily to el paso
and sps . currently they have no operational capability to provide any more
incremental delivery capabilities to tw at tumbleweed . however , they have
indicated a probable second raton expansion project will be announced march
2001 and have suggested that looping of this southern line could be a
possible outcome of the project which would provide incremental delivery
capacity to transwestern above the current 40 mmcf / d level . i will be having
additional discussions with cig marketing individuals to determine who ,
besides el paso and evergreen , are the primary existing shippers down the
southern portion of cig ' s system in order to potentially get them to realign
their contract to transwestern as a primary delivery point .
expedition of contracting process - per kevin ' s request , i provided him , and
also discussed , several ideas which would streamline and improve the existing
contract processing cycle . the most important and critical recommendation
was to revise the 3 year old et & s discounting policy which bill cordes had
established for both tw and northern . obtaining approval of even a few
simple changes i could recommend to the policy ( applicable only to
transwestern , not nng ) would have an immediate effect of simplying the
officer approval process and would expedite the turn - around time .",ham,2000-11-17

subject : government affairs organization announcement
with the announcement of enron ' s acquisition by dynegy behind us , and with the initial severance process completed , it seemed an appropriate time to effect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future . before i turn to the organizational changes , i would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving the company as a result of the initial severance ( you ' ll know who they are by their absence on the organizational chart ) : leading and being a part of this group has been a privilege ? i am thankful for every day that i have had that responsibility and thankful for however long i continue to have the responsibility . this sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicated group of professionals and support staff and who , to a person , are also very decent and good people . to say good - bye to some of our colleagues is not easy . i want to , on behalf of all of us , thank them for their hard work , their integrity , their decency , and the good times and laughter that we shared . i trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special . thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done .
as to the organizational structure , it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization , with a mix of groups organized along functional and regional lines ( particularly within the u . s . ) , has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times . the need to rationalize the organizational structure , in order to consolidate all u . s . energy functions , is a strong need from my perspective . as a result , jim steffes will lead the u . s . energy group along with sue nord , who will jointly report to jim and myself . sue will assist jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to help jim shoulder a significant burden . also reporting to jim will be a leadership group for u . s . energy that will be as follows : wholesale electricity will be led by christi nicolay ; retail electricity and natural gas will be led by harry kingerski ; wholesale gas will be led by leslie lawner . last , but not least , jeff dasovich and sue mara , who will continue to focus on california energy issues , will report to jim . ( sue mara will also be part of the wholesale electricity team ) .
steve montovano , who will continue to report to me , will lead a commercial development effort along with dan allegretti .
with the elimination of the regional groups , i also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political / legislative needs across the u . s . paul kaufman will lead a small group that will address that need and that will focus on state political support . paul will also take the lead for government affairs in support of corporate development efforts across the u . s .
much of the rest of the group remains the same . linda robertson will continue to lead the washington group with sarah novosel , who reports to linda , taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at ferc . amr ibrahim will continue to lead the support of the global assets group and also continue to manage the risk analytics function . maggy huson will take over support of the non - energy business units , which are as follows : global markets , industrial markets , networks , and broadband . rob hemstock will continue to lead the support of enron canada . paul dawson , who heads up government affairs for europe ; sergio assad , who heads up government affairs for south america ; and mike grimes and mark crowther , who head up our asian efforts , will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself .
i am also forming a north american leadership group for government affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company . that committee will consist of rob hemstock , maggy huson , amr ibrahim , paul kaufman , harry kingerski , leslie lawner , steve montovano , christi nicolay , sue nord , sarah novosel , linda robertson , jim steffes and myself . we will also continue to have an rcr committee that will consist of maggy huson , harry kingerski , sue nord , linda robertson , jim steffes & myself . finally , i am forming a dynegy / enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of jose bestard , paul dawson , paul kaufman , sue nord , sarah novosel and myself .
no organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perfect or permanent . i believe these changes will make us better and more prepared for the future . however , we must be prepared to further adjust as the future unfolds for the company .
one final note : i am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company . we are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our group fundamentally altered , but we must resolve to do our best for each other and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges , for those of us who do remain a part of the new dynegy , reflects the excellence and integrity that has characterized our group . personally , i will do all i can , for as long as i can , to steer the group through this to the very best place possible . your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated . hang in there and thanks .",ham,2001-11-16

653,14007,re : preliminary cost savings for ea,"our current plan on ea operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10 % . i will get with you on tuesday morning to review the names , but i feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys , as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders . our current estimate on cost reductions for ea operations is less than the $ 5 . 4 mm estimated 2 weeks ago .
beth perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow . we are in agreement , as bob hall has worked with beth ' s team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems ( mkm enhancements , unify production tuning , decaf strategic rewrite , and one other that escapes me at the moment ) . beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially - driven it projects . the headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what beth ' s team is focused on tonight .

pretty huge cuts , i agree on cutting costs , its more about redefining and you may want to realign your business ( as you said bring in some people from other areas ) . this is probably all the detail i ' ll require . let me have your final numbers when you can . obviously if there are any senior position changes i think the gas and power guys would have a view as they do know who they like or not .
we do want to run the business as is , i think the big difference is new it projects , we should still look at them but ones on a short time scale . on operations i think we just know that any growth planning we had envisaged is no longer required - we need to just get back to where we were .

subject : preliminary cost savings for ea
from our work weekend before last , our third scenario ( staying in the business , but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels ) , our estimated savings for operations and it development were :
annualized savings ( in millions ) & headcount reductions ( enron employees )
direct costs bonus subtotal net cap total
ops it accural savings severance savings ex savings
5 . 4 12 . 8 1 . 5 19 . 7 3 . 8 15 . 9 11 . 8 27 . 7 dollar savings
65 71 - 136 fte reduction
this work was not done at the level of identifying individuals , but rather positions . identify indiour work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals ' names . we have already identified our lower performers across operations and it as well . we had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting eim and egm who could potentially support ea and ees in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units .
the above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from jenny rub , which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued ( i . e . server savings ) . the estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the eol charges for ea that may result from cost reductions that greg piper is having with brad richter .
your desire to cut costs for ea but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible . we will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you .

adeola - hopewell str .
victoria - island , lagos
dear sir ,
first , i must solicit your confidence in this transaction ; this is by virtue of
its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret . though i know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried , but i
am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have decided to
contact you by e - mail due to the urgency of this transaction . let me start by
first introducing myself properly to you . i am dr . dan nkanga , a manager in
advances department of the zenith international bank ltd , lagos . i came to know
of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a
very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of
money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . i am not too really
sure if you are my long lost contact whom i am trying to reach , but in anyway ,
please do take this message with a good heart and report back to me if you are
not the person i think you are . i would explain more latter .
the proposition :
a foreigner , late engineer sann clarke , an oil merchant / contractor with the
federal government of nigeria , until his death three years ago in a ghastly air
crash , banked with us here at zenith bank lagos , and had a closing balance of
usd $ 27 . 5 m ( twenty seven million and five hundred thousand , united states
dollars ) which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his
available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited
trust fund for the purchase of arms and ammunition at a military war college
here in nigeria . a fervent valuable effort has been made by our bank ( zenith
international bank ) to get in touch with any of the clarke family or relatives
but all have proved to no avail . it is because of the perceived possibility of
not going to be able to locate any of late engr . sann clarke  s next of kin ,
wife or children that our chairman and board of directors have decided to
declare the funds ( unclaimed ) and then be subsequently donated to the
discredited trust fund for the purchase of arms and ammunitions for war in
africa against other continent in the world . in order to avert this negative
development , myself and some of my trusted collaborating colleagues here at the
bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as late engr . sann clarke  s
next of kin so that the funds could be subsequently transferred into your bank
account as the beneficiary  s next of kin . all documents and proves to
authenticate you as the rightful next of kin to the beneficiary will be
carefully arranged such that the deal will be a 100 % risk free involvement . for
your assistance and collaboration , your commission will be 20 % , 75 % shall be
for myself and my collaborating colleagues for investment purposes in your
country while 5 % will be set aside for any expenses that would be incurred in
the process of the transfer .
if this proposal is ok , and you do not wish to take advantage of the trust we
hope to bestow on you and your company , then kindly get to me immediately via
my most exclusive e - mail : nkanga 2 @ portugalmail . com furnishing me with your
most confidential telephone , fax number and exclusive e - mail so that i can

greg and rex ,
thanks for the input . i will try to contact beth apollo .
here are a few points i think will help .
? i also read the partnering agreement carefully and sent the revised copy to
travis mccullough this morning
? at this time i believe our risk is quite low , as we are not officially part
of the bid yet
? i will work very hard to keep everyone informed
the following points protect enron from significant risk :
1 ) we were quite careful about what we sent to csg ( reviewed by beth ,
david , rahul and myself )
2 ) we did not quote any price for software or services
3 ) the original rfp asked for a custom solution , which cgi is proposing . we
do not participate in this work .
4 ) the option to take a different approach ( e . g . leverage existing software
from a partner ) is being proposed by csg as an alternative approach , but is
not priced . the option would be explored during a "" make versus buy "" analysis
within csg ' s methodology ( during the initial requirements and design phase ) .
this gives us time to clarify our plans .
i hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of
the proposal . as the proposal is due on monday , i am not sure if there is
time to engage a large number of reviewers , but i will ask csg to copy rahul
and hopefully he can get appropriate input .

for review , this weekend and on monday
? the proposal is due monday pm to cms
? presentations to cms by potential vendors will occur on march 26 th - 28 th .
we should think about who attends and at what point we might want to use our
internal contacts to approach the client . for now we are waiting , based on

vnbl stock expected to explode ! ! !
vinoble is the next hot play in homeland security
symbol : vnbl . ob
current price : $ 0 . o 8
short term target price : $ o . 5 o
12 month target price : $ 4 . oo
deserves your immediate attention ! ! !
the company just bottomed at $ o . o 6 and we believe in the next 1 to 2
weeks this stock will go back to at least $ 0 . 40
c o m p a n y o v e r v i e w
vinoble , inc . ( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and
acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland
security , security information systems , and other security services to
provide long term growth for its shareholders .
vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in
the security sector is unprecedented .
the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2 ool have
changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both
physical
and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments ,
especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the
focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security
services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of
forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products
and
services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2 oo 5 .
vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security
market by delivering professional services , security products , security
training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective ,
vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals
offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s
consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will
help
organizations protect key assets including persons , property ,
information ,
brand , and reputation .
homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the
healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) ,
sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued
increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble
intends
to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical
and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients ,
alliance
partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are
the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious
provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of
each
client .
management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( "" gccc "" ) to assist
in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such
acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at
present ,
vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential
acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and
audits , the
company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis
required for listing on a national exchange .
here is recent news on the company :
malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 2 o , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb :
vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information
systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it
continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition
of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps
tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional
businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software ,
and patents .
following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification )
technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use
applications , the company has concluded that the need for application
support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the
framework which operates such technology . the company has identified
several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software ,
and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element .
middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both
internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves
routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into
different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web
services and service - oriented architectures .
since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and
non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling
customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important
in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with
customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of
assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the
manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will
enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to
shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply
chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid
and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system .
the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology
will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing
rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide
critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of
businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and
assets in this current state of constant threat .

on january 12 , i hosted a brainstorming session at the four seasons hotel in
downtown houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and
back office services we could offer to the commodity industry . to complete a
plan for launching this strategic commercial venture , we are hosting an
integrated design session facilitated by cap gemini ernst & young ( cgey ) at
their accelerated solutions environment in dallas , texas .
i am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this design
session . this is a critical two - day event to be held february 12 th and 13 th
in dallas , texas . this work session is based on a unique approach called a
designshop  v . it is a very focused , activity - driven event that is composed of
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups . if you
have not attended one of the designshops related to sap , you will likely
regard this session as different from any working session you have previously
experienced . the prior designshops held in conjunction with sap have proven
to be very successful . therefore , we have elected to utilize this same
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture .
a limited number of representatives from enron will be attending . you were
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in the
designshop . you are being asked to participate in the full two days with as
little distraction or interruption as possible . the quality of our results
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the
entire event . additionally , you will be relied on in the future to support
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session .
this date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods so

a few words about tom . he is a power engineer type who has previously worked
at northwestern us and new zealand utilities on various projects including
asset planning and hydro scheduling . he was hired by ei structuring to
oversee modeling efforts using sddp , henwood , etc . because of the recent
implosion at ei apache , tom ' s group has effectively evaporated , and thus he
is looking for a new home . he has some finance background from having to
do asset evaluation for utility rate filings . he has almost no options
experience . he seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of or
problems .
clearly the most obvious fit is with my group , but the idea is for you all to
see if tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects .
and , as usual , the personality fit is the other aspect to examine .
this is meant to be casual . if the consensus is positive , then i will explore
the formalities of such a transfer .

as we discussed , the following is a list of diligence items that we would
like to explore further . this list is not all inclusive and we may need to
discuss additional items as we continue with due diligence . please let me
know when we could meet to discuss them further . kevin and i had
tentatively scheduled a november 28 , 2001 meeting to discuss development of
purchase and sale agreements and possibly some of the items listed below :
assuming that the megs system includes the riser and topside equipment
on marathon ' s sp 89 platform , we will need verify potential liability for
the same and any agreements addressing such access . we would also like
to review the production handling agreement between burlington / mariner
and marathon to verify the impact it may have on the future operation of
the system
we will need a definitive representation from enron as to the status of
the producers committment obligations as of december 1 , 2001 as defined
in the gathering agreements , including any credits due from prior years
excess flows . it is our understanding that for the month of december
there will be a $ 93 , 000 credit to the payment due gatherer and there are
no credits due in 2002 .
in the gathering agreement "" project payout "" is referenced from the
producer ' s joa . please provide verification that this payout has
occured , the ownership percentage is now 51 % mariner and 49 % burlington
and that there is no future change that could affect the megs agreements
need to review sample invoices , sample gas and condensate measurement
statements and demonstration of timely payment of such invoices by
producers
have there been any leaks incurred and / or reported on the system ? are
there any outstanding environmental issues on this system ?
it is assumed that enron / megs will be responsible to obtain any
assignments / consents that may be required to complete the transaction .
please verify that this will be done .
the agreement stipulates that the insurance required is to include
business interruption coverage . please provide the coverage
declarations of the existing policy in effect for the system as a
reference for defs
please provide a contact person who can discuss the environmental status
of the system with a defs ehs representative
who is the mms right of way owner and who is the mms operator of record .
please verify that the appropriate party has provided the mms with a
"" certificate of financial responsibility ""
we may want to schedule a site visit to sp 89 . please provide the
contacts to make these arrangements
we would like to review any additional pipeline engineering data and
material specifications available , inspection and hydrostatic test
reports , as - built drawings , environental reports / permits , rights of
way / permit documents and other related engineering and construction
information

subject : lc to peoples
here is the current situation with third party credit support .
wisconsin public service ( wps )
- 5 day storage svc , 4 months ( 11 / 10 / 01 - 3 / 10 / 01 ) , total value = $ 240 , 000 demand charge , plus minor commodity premium on injection gas
- guarantee : $ 5 million total ( i think we can get this lowered somewhat , maybe $ 3 million )
- per rudwell johnson in credit , wps will only accept a surety bond from enron . otherwise , 100 % guarantee from peoples .
options :
1 - issue peoples an lc for enron ' s portion of the guarantee
2 - accept a sharing percentage different than 50 / 50 . 75 / 25 may work , but some in their shop are pushing for as high as 90 / 10 . this sets an extremely dangerous precedent for future deals and may have negative implications for the long term viability of enovate . i am concerned about the message this will send .
3 - let the deal blow up and force people ' s hand through the restricted activities language of the operating agreement . this has obvious downsides from customer perception to the potential unwinding of enovate .
i have suggested many other options but they have not been receptive to them . for instance , only issue an lc if we are rated junk .
nrg
- fuel managment services for testing phase of a combined cycle plant , term : 11 / 20 / 01 - 3 / 31 / 02 , total value = $ 100 , 000 demand charge , plus variable charges based on usage .
- guarantee : they have not given us a number yet . they have initially indicated they will not take enron credit . rudwell will be contacting them today to determine if they will take enron credit and what the amount will be .
options :
same as above
other third party business
counterparty service term total demand charge
wisconsin gas 10 day storage service 3 yrs ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 05 ) $ 1 , 100 , 000
wisconsin gas 50 day storage service 3 yrs ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 05 ) $ 3 , 375 , 000
txu storage service 1 yr ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 03 ) $ 990 , 000
oneok storage service 1 yr ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 03 ) $ 875 , 000
pg & e storage service 1 yr ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 03 ) $ 840 , 000
pancanadian storage service 1 yr ( 4 / 1 / 02 - 3 / 31 / 03 ) $ 402 , 500
none of the above counterparties have explicitly stated they will not take enron credit yet . wisconsin gas has called and expressed concern over enron , particularly given the term . txu has also called and tried to wiggle a little bit on the deal as a result of enron ' s situation . we have put them off for the time being . hopefully , we have enough time before the above deals start to reassure them of our credit .
let me know if you have further questions and i will keep you posted .

date : wednesday , august 1 , 2001 12 : 16 : 55 gmt
subject :
dear colleague ,
the edison electric institute just published a paper , the california
electricity crisis : lessons for other states , which i wrote . the paper is
available on the publications page of my website , www . ehirst . com
. please let me know if you have any comments on
the paper .
here is a summary of the paper :
california was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter
electricity future . that future , as outlined by the california public
utilities commission in 1994 , envisioned an electricity industry featuring
competitive markets . such markets were intended to produce lower costs and
more choices for consumers , while ensuring profits for efficient energy
suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old , inefficient power plants .
although the first two years of restructuring ( beginning in april
1998 ) seemed to bear out these promises , the last year has been a disaster
for california ' s electricity consumers , taxpayers , and electric utilities .
part of the fallout from california ' s electricity crisis is considerable
concern - even opposition - in other states to restructuring the electricity
industry .
although a few states have decided , based on the california
experience , not to restructure , i believe that is the wrong outcome .
instead , the primary lessons other states should learn from california are
that competitive markets can work ; competition is not to blame for
california ' s problems ; and basic economic principles of supply , demand , and
prices affect market outcomes .
section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity
regulation and restructuring in california and the problems that occurred
beginning in may 2000 . section 3 , the heart of this paper , offers guidance
to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity
industry . this section makes several points :
* maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new
generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned
to meet growing loads .
* ensure that enough infrastructure ( transmission capacity and natural
gas pipeline capacity ) is in place and planned to meet growing loads ,
maintain reliability , connect new generators to the grid , support large
regional markets , and provide fuel to power plants .
* encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic - pricing and
voluntary - load - reduction programs ( i . e . , couple retail and wholesale
markets ) .
* create honest retail competition : avoid standard - offer rates with
artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to
offer retail services without favoring individual competitors .
* encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply
and price risks .
* create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy ,
ancillary services , and transmission congestion .
* monitor and minimize horizontal market power ( generation ) and
vertical market power ( combined ownership and operation of generation and
transmission ) .
ultimately , competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and
prices , better align consumer prices with producer costs , improve producer
efficiency in both investment and operation , maintain or improve
reliability , and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing
options .
but , this transition from one industry structure to another is
turning out to be long and complicated . it is complicated because
electricity is so important to our modern , high - tech society ; electricity is
our most flexible fuel , providing light , heat , motive power , and the energy
to operate all our electronic equipment . also , electricity truly is a
real - time product for which production and consumption must occur at the
same time .
although the problems that have occurred in california are
substantial and worrisome , regulators and legislators in other states should
focus on the long - term benefits of competitive electricity markets and
accept the possible short - term problems that may occur . they also need to
recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond
the boundaries of any single state . finally , competition in retail and
wholesale markets must be coordinated ; in particular , it is not possible to
have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces
time varying prices .
if states restructure properly to create competitive markets for
wholesale energy and retail services , we should all benefit . consumers will
enjoy lower prices , they will have many more choices of energy services and
price - risk tradeoffs , reliability will be improved because most reliability
services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict ,
and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants
will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers .

christie ,
as we talked last thursday via video teleconference , we are planning to
narrow our scope to focus on a marketing / promotion plan for newpower
including value - added products and services for the future . before we talk
again on thursday , we would like to speak with john henderson again to see if
he recommends any specific items he would like us to address .
we are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a
phone meeting between us , or if it would be best to include him in our next
video teleconference . we are available the next two days at lpm and 4 pm
houston time .
we understand that john is a very busy person , and we appreciate any help you
can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his
expectations .
thanks ,

741,12191,re : what ' s happening with el paso arbitration ?,"they are apparently not going to roll over .
as you are well aware , we filed an arbitration against epme under the swap agreement and el paso corp . under the guaranty . our hope was that once the el paso legal department got involved this would come to an amicable resolution . not so fast . while epme recognizes that it is contractually obligated to arbitrate under the swap agreement , el paso corp . is claiming that it is not subject to arbitration and has filed a lawsuit asking a court to declare that el paso corp . is not subject to arbitration .
we had a call with el paso ' s lawyers early this morning to discuss where we are and where we are going . we told el paso ' s lawyers that we will agree to drop el paso corp . from the arbitration if they agree to drop their lawsuit . ( i have talked to duran and deffner about this and they have made it clear that our overriding objective is to monetize the swap agreement . to do so , we need an arbitration panel ' s ruling on the confidentiality provision in the swap agreement . the guaranty issue is , in their view , of secondary concern at this time ) . during the call , epme asked for 10 days to name their party arbitrator . we agreed . by the way , we have already appointed our party arbitrator . el paso ' s lawyers are going to check with their client today to confirm that the lawsuit will be dropped .
on the arbitration front , once epme names its party arbitrator , the two party arbitrators will get together and select a neutral arbitrator . we should expect that process to take about 30 days . then the entire arbitration panel will get together and set an arbitration schedule .
i will keep you updated .

this has been on hold for some time now . we need to increase the l / c to keep our foreign primary casualty coverage in place . the total value of the l / c would be $ 288 , 700 . it is not much of an increase we need , yet there is zero capacity from the bank to handle our request . failure to act could send a very negative message to the insurance market if we can ' t handle this small a request . just thought you should be made aware .

748,17167,"read this , please","sound reasonable ? or should i be more firm ?
a reminder . . . .
in an effort to curb el paso settlements issues , i ' ve requested several sets of tapes over the past few days . as you know , these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings . however , none of the taped conversations i ' ve listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for ; many didn ' t name a delivery point ; and some left out a price .
because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours , re - confirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form . a quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment they ' re created , or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that .
as always , let me know if you have questions about this .

subject : pge park suite talk - first right of refusal
one of the benefits of our suite at pge park is that we have the first right of refusal on non - portland family entertainment events such as psu football games and the city jazzfest concert . ena will periodically receive notices of such events so as to determine our level of interest in purchasing the tickets before they are available to the general public . non - portland family entertainment ticket purchase opportunities are for enron employees , and the tickets may not be resold to outside parties .
if you are interested in purchasing tickets for either the psu football games or city jazzfest , please notify me via e - mail by 2 pm pacific time , friday , june 8 . these tickets are to be purchased by the employee . the entire suite must be purchased by enron employees in order for us to obtain the tickets . twenty - two tickets per event are available : 18 are seats and stools , 4 are standing room .
? the price for city jazzfest ( sunday , july 15 ) is $ 916 for 22 tickets = about $ 42 per ticket .
? the price for all 6 psu vikings games ( 22 tickets each ) is $ 1 , 404 : about $ 11 per game , per person , and all 6 games must be purchased .
we will proceed with ticket purchase and distribution after you establish your commitment .
please let me know if you have any questions .
best regards ,

e - procurement issues . in enron corp , however , there is an initiative called
ibuyit . this is a system that corp is deploying for e - procurement through
corp and ena , and will get to ebs sometime late this year .
john gillespie is in charge of the ibuyit initiative . perhaps he is the

dr . kaminski ,
sorry for the late response ,
it took me some time to coordinate things .
finally , it ' s almost dont : - )
it turned out that from june to august
will be best for me for work at enron
( say june . 4 to august . 4 )
but i still need to know several things from your side .
could you answer following questions ?
first :
is my suggested working period is ok with you ?
if so , let me know what to do for settlement
during the period .
second :
i got a list of work , i might be able to do for
dealbench team from ross and suresh .
i ' d like to know it is still a valid work list :
the list he sent is as following :
> 1 . write a paper in layman ' s terms that answers
> questions like the following :
> benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers , particularly in reverse auctions
> explanation how multi - variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price - only auctions ( is this true ? )
> how many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> what types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> opinions on lotting strategies
> trends in online private auctions
> 2 . identify appropriate recent auction research ( 3
> or 4 papers out of the 90 + you provided ) and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site
> 3 . create a list / bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature ( with hyperlinks ? )
> 4 . would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers ( if they are interested )
third :
there is an e - procurement forum at haas school of business ,
in may 22 . the chair of the forum is my advisor prof . arie segev .
a person from wells fargo bank will talk about wells fargo ' s role
in e - marketplace payment initiative ,
where enron broadband services is also one of key players
along with citibank .
he asked me whether you can contact a person at
enron broadband services , who ' s related to the initiative .
he wants to know whether we will have a speaker from enron
to see enron ' s perspective , in the forum .
here is a link to news related to the initiative ,
fourth :
my advisor wants to know whether
there could be any opportunity to do a case study ,
regarding enron ' s business .
he is interested in e - procurement and e - marketplaces .
business model and system architecture . . .
thanks for reading this long email .
i ' ll look forward to your answer . .
i am sorry for giving you so much burden
to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer .
warm regards ,

as i mentioned in my voicemail to you today after seeing the note from neil
mcgregor , there is no possible way that anshuman could be in the us to work
on february 5 th . until i receive all of his documents , and the necessary
information from you regarding his position in the us , i do not have the
information to send to the attorneys for the visa application .
once they receive the paperwork , they will need to prepare the documents in
triplicate , and send to me . at this stage , i will send the documents to
anshuman in india and he will need to make an appointment at the us consulate
in order to have the ll visa stamped into his passport . he will not be able
to come to the states to work without this visa in his passport ! all of this
could take approx . 3 - 4 weeks to accomplish . i think march would be a more
realistic timeframe !
please let me have your thoughts .

donna & george ,
please let me know if my assumption is in error . i have a schematic that shows these meters going to hgpl off of gepl big cowboy , however , if this is not correct then i will need to try to find the gas in another manner .

the structure involves selling the erc ' s at market to an entity controlled by the bank ; buying a call from that entity ; selling a put to that entity ; having a price swap ( fixed / floating ) with entity . the bank would also want to understand market liquidity , price transparency and the rules of every district we have erc ' s in . the texas sox deal recently put into this vehicle was much simpler in a more liquid market , but it took 4 months and $ 1 mm of legal fees to put together . the lawyers involved believe that it would be more difficult and likely more expensive for the california erc ' s - we have several districts and several products .
$ 1 mm + internal resources seems like a lot for a $ 20 mm - $ 30 mm balance with an expected term of one year - especially with uncertain success due to the price transparency issues ( no index price ) .
any thoughts ?

hong kong .
email : wng _ qn @ yahoo . com
let me start by introducing myself . i am mr . wang qin ,
credit officer of the hang seng bank ltd . i have a
concealed business suggestion for you . before the u . s
and iraqi war our client general . ibrahim moussa who
was with the iraqi forces and also a business man made
a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months , with
a value of twenty six million five hundred thousand
united state dollars ( us $ 26 , 500 . 000 . 00 ) only in my
branch . upon maturity several notices were sent to
him , even during the war early this year . again after
the war another notification was sent and still no
response came from him . we later find out that the
general and his family had been killed during the war
in a bomb blast that hit their home .
after further investigation it was also discovered
that gen . ibrahim moussa did not declare any next of
kin in his official papers including the paper work of
his bank deposit . and he also confided in me the last
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of
his deposit in my bank . so , twenty six million , five
hundred thousand united state dollars is still lying
in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim
it . what bothers me most is that according to the to
the laws of my country , at the expiration of three
years the funds will revert to the ownership of the
hong kong government if nobody applies to claim the
funds . against this backdrop , my suggestion to you is
that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the
next of kin to gen . ibrahim moussa so that you will be
able to receive his funds .
what is to be done :
i want you to know that i have had everything planned
out so that we shall come out successful . i have
contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary
documents that will back you up as the next of kin to
gen . ibrahim moussa , all that is required from you at
this stage is for you to provide me with your full
names and address so that the attorney can commence
his job . after you have been made the next of kin , the
attorney will also file for claims on your behalf and
secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in
your favor for the movement of the funds . there is no
risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to
adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare
all the necessary documents . please endeavor to
observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning
this issue .
once the funds have been transferred , we shall share
in the ratio of 70 % for me , 25 % for you and 5 % for any
expenses incurred during the course of this operation .
should you be interested , please contact me via email
as i am not fluent in english and i would like all
communication to be via email .
as soon as i get your response , i will provide you
with more details of this operation . your earliest
response to this letter will be appreciated .
kind regards

i am prince fayad w . bolkiah , the eldest son of prince jefri bolkiah , former finance minister of brunei , the tiny oil - rich sultanate on the northern coast of the island of borneo , in eastern asia . i will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history , which has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother , the sultan of brunei sheik muda hassanal bolkiah .
as you may know from the international media , the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of us $ 14 . 8 billion dollars . this was as a result of the asian financial crisis that made my father company amedeo development company and government owned brunei investment company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office . however my father was kept under house arrest , his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the sultanate .
furthermore , during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives , but before i could do that i was placed under house arrest by the sultan and i have no access to a phone but i have a palm v hand - held computer from which i am sending you this mail . before my incaceration , i went ahead to dispatch the sum of fifty eight million five hundred thousand united states dollars us $ 58 . 5 million in cash under special arrangement into the custody of a private security and trustee company for safe keeping abroad .
hence i seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family abroad . i have decided to offer 10 % of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation .
please i count on your absolute confidentiality , transparency and trust while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of this business transaction .
i remain yours sincerely .

796,6098,re : lng may 19 decision,"john ,
this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .
1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash
and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island
project ( please , see point 2 ) .
2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest
( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island
transaction . the next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .
a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :
a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term
contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .
the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the
long - term
contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are
setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .
b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension
option of
5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we
have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for
such a long tenor . this is
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread
and
i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .
one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the
first
5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .
c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market .
d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island
deal
( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .
long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail
that
correlates very well with brent .

801,21624,real - time alert for hot stock feature,"montana oil and gas , inc . ( mogi ) to expiore further opportunities in
alberta canada , is an energy developer in canada ' s most highly coveted
reservoirs .
aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi | and gas
( mogi ) again this morning ! montana oi | and gas inc . ( mogi - news )
announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is stil | awaiting a
rig at this time . the surface | ease has been constructed and we have
been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks , and
anticipate this to happen next week at the latest .
the company has a 25 % working interest in the sylvan lake project .
symbol - mogi
price - $ . 43
reasons to conside mogi :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with muitiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves potentiaily worth multi - miliions , mogi is selling for | ess
than 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets .
4 . montana oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises . already
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | |
market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors
for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers like montana oil ( mogi ) that the biggest gains
are being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple
and even quadrupie returns .
vancouver , british coiumbia , march 30 , 2 oo 5 ( primezone ) - - montana oil
and gas , inc . , ( pink sheets : mogi ) president peter sanders is please to
announce the following update on its sylvan lake project .
after severa | delays due to unseasonabie weather and road ciosures in
the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig was moved onto
| ocation
over the weekend and ensign dri | | ing has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m we | |
a
nd are currentiy driiling at 1 , 25 o feet . surface casing wil | be run to
930 feet . the drilling rig is known as a telescopic double and is rated
to dri | | to lo , 00 o feet in depth . drilling operations are expected to
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the county may impose a
restriction
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring
breakup
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage . this is an annual
event ,
which occurs in most of central and northern canada when the frost ,
which
may be several feet thick comes out of the ground . drilling operations
for
a | arge rig such as the sylvan lake wel | requires service by heavy
vehicies
such as mud , water , cement and vacuum trucks which wiil be prohibited
from
using the roads during this period of time . peter sanders notes ,
§ the road bans that have been taking piace ail over alberta happen
every year
and in the spring is no surprise , a | | oi | and gas companies are
effected by
breakup , the good thing is , is that we have the rig on site , which wi | |
remain there until we are finished dri | | ing , surface casing has been
compieted and we wiil be ready to finish driliing the minute the road
bans are | ifted .
the syivan lake prospect is a we | | defined 3 - d seismic structural high
within a preserved pekisko remnant isiand that may have virgin
reservoirs
with simiiar production potentia | as the adjacent n poo | where 6 wells
have
produced 680 , oo 0 barrels oi | since 1997 . in overall , the syivan fieid
has
produced 4 o mi | | ion barreis of oi | from the pekisko formation and 50
bi | | ion
cubic feet of gas from the shunda formation .
ensign dri | | ing wil | test a tota | of 3 o feet from severa | zones in the
shunda
formation at 7 , 155 feet and a 30 - foot pekisko oi | formation at 7 , 320
feet .
when driiling resumes , the hoie is pianned to reach a tota | depth of
7 , 570 feet ,
which may take some lo days to then complete drilling and testing .
each deveiopment weil has probabie production of 150 barrels of oil per
day
and 750 ? thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1
biilion
cubic feet gas and 30 o , ooo barreis of oi | . there are four other pay
zones that
are prospective for gas . the average we | | in the sylvan lake field has
produced
500 barreis of oi | per day and / or over one miliion cubic feet of gas
per day .
if successful , the company intends to dril | up to 4 more welis on these
land
sections . this immediate area has been developed for both oi | and
natural gas
over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas
gathering and
processing faciiities and oil transportation faciiities have been
constructed .

802,11883,california update 6 / 11 / 01,"executive summary :
? california claims victory over easing power prices
? california ' s budget doesn ' t look good for a vote on friday
power prices
sources report that generator ' s acknowledge that the drop in power prices in california last week was due at least in part to the threat of price controls . generators and traders are reportedly increasingly unwilling to line up power inventory over the next few months , which sources believe is likely to lead to increased volatility . while governor davis issued statements attributing easing power prices to his negotiating long - term contracts and made no note of increased hydrogenation in the northwest and lighter demand from cool weather in california .
california budget has friday deadline
sources indicate that the california legislature missing the june 15 th budget deadline , which appears likely , may affect california ' s ability to secure future financing . coupled with poor macroeconomic indicators ( such as increasing unemployment ) , the outlook for the state does not look good . sources report that the budget would have to go to print today in order for it to be printed for a vote on friday . while not going to print today does not mean that there will not be a vote friday , sources are pessimistic that the legislature will agree on a budget by friday . the republicans are reportedly concerned that the 12 . 5 b in revenue bonds will not sell when they are issued . the republicans are asking for a $ 3 - $ 5 b budget reserve as insurance against this possibility . they want to achieve this by cutting the increases to programs ( such as education , which was increased more than was mandated by law ) while leaving base program amounts alone . however , to date there has been failure to reach agreement among members over which programs to cut .",ham,2001-06-11

library ( in r : \ exotica which everybody in risk management has access to )
instead of the old visual basic code in the powermod file . this improved the
calculation speed for options quite a bit .
we are also embarking on a new project to develop the next generation
structuring and pricing models . i will discuss about this project in more
detail with you soon and get your input , but the main goals i see now are :
1 . superior performance ( speed ) to enable fast pricing especially for the
underwriting group ,
2 . proper documentation for easy maintenance and ability to quickly adapt to
meet future needs , and
3 . security / access control to the files .
the first stage in this process is to take inventory of what we have : i am
documenting the current structuring models . this step is important not only
for developing our next generation models but also for the aa audit of all
the ees pricing models .

louise ,
as you know , we were told during today ' s integration committee call that marketing ' s and legal ' s text changes for the
website would be accepted any time today . following the call , however , i was told that the noon deadline was firm , but
we could make minor text changes on thursday . based on that information , we forwarded partial comments to kal shah by
noon . in a late afternoon email , i found out that we will not be able to complete our changes until perhaps five days
after the site goes live .
we appreciate the pressure and long hours people in houston are putting into getting the site up and running . we applaud
their efforts and do not wish to add to their burden . i tell you this only to make you aware of our situation , should
any problems arise because of the unedited text . hopefully , if anything does arise , problems can be easily and quickly
corrected .
please call me at 212 - 713 - 8508 if you have any questions or if i can help you in any way .
thank you ,

826,12532,approvals on monterrey expenditures,"jaime ,
while reviewing some recent expenditures out of the monterrey office it was noted that several checks signed by you did not have properly approved supporting documentation . the absence of properly approved documentation for expenditures is a violation of enron corporate treasury policies and enron north america standard operating procedure . specifically we found three expense reports which were reimbursed to mr . jaime alatorre for expenses from april to august , that were not authorized by anyone prior to the check being signed and released to mr . alatorre .
i understand that a transition has been taking place involving you and steve irvin as a result of the departure of max yzaguirre and that confusion about proper authorizations during this transition probably led to this circumstance but i wanted to let you know that adherence to enron ' s authorization policies is crucial to our internal control structure and that violations will not be permitted .
susan helton will soon be discussing with you the entire process of disbursing funds out of the monterrey and mexico city offices in an attempt to get the internal controls in this area consistent with those in other enron remote offices . i expect some of the major changes to be as follows :
* mexico city petty cash account to be closed
* two signatures to be required on all checks \ wires ; you and steve irvin
* checks to be processed once a week only ( except emergencies ) which will help with the availability of you and steve
* expense reports of jaime williams , jaime alatorre and steve irvin to be authorized by louise kitchen prior to being reimbursed

833,23062,"mg staff visits - - tuesday , wednesday and thursday . . . this week !","dear all ,
as you know , we will be hosting staff from mg tomorrow evening and on
wednesday and thursday evening for a presentation / overview on enron and a
tour of enron house . the mg staff have not been selected by department for
these events , but rather have been given the option to sign up on a
first - come , first - serve basis . i anticipate having approximately 35 people
on tuesday , 20 on wednesday and 35 on thursday . the members of mg ' s
management who joined us on the 8 th of june are not attending this week in
order to provide their colleagues with an opportunity to visit the building
( hence the smaller numbers ) .
the purpose of these events is to help mg staff get better acquainted with
enron and to see first - hand where they will be relocating to in september .
to this end , i would like to invite all of you to attend at least one of
three events with a view to being on hand to act as a host / hostess ,
potentially join tours of the building and to be on hand to field any
specific questions which may come up about your respective departments . i
hope this will also prove to be a good opportunity for you to meet mg staff
on a more informal basis .
the schedule of events each night will be as follows :
17 : 45 - 18 : 00 mg staff arrive at enron house
18 : 00 - 18 : 05 welcome and introductions : eric gadd
18 : 05 - 18 : 15 enron video
18 : 15 - 18 : 40 presentation on enron and enron europe : mark schroeder
( tuesday )
fernley dyson ( wednesday )
john thompson ( thursday )
18 : 40 - 19 : 30 tours of enron house / drinks & canap , s
19 : 30 - 19 : 45 depart for home by bus to liverpool street station [ or
directly from enron house ]
i know that many of you have been keen to participate in this kind of
informal event with our new colleagues at mg , so i hope you will be able to
join us . so that we can get a feel for numbers , i would appreciate it if
you could rsvp to me by 2 : 00 p . m . tomorrow regarding your participation for
all three events . please note that due to a number of enron staff
participating in the chase corporate challenge on wednesday evening , i am
very short on "" tour guides "" . so , if you can make it on wednesday evening and
if you feel up to it , please advise if you can lead a tour of the building ( a
map and cheat sheet will be provided ! ! ) .

845,32339,dear friend .,"dear friend .
as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday .
my name is shadak shari , a merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts .
i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world .
i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends .
i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore .
i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them .
the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of seven million dollars $ 7 , 000 , 000 , that i have with a
finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations .
i have set aside 10 % for you for your time and patience . please send a reply through this email address ( shadakshario 01 @ telkom . net ) with your full contact information for more private and confidential
communication .
god be with you .

subject : trend analysis for select commodity groups
attached is a trend analysis on the four primary commodity groups which have
either been demonstrating , or have been thought to be demonsrating , a decline
in eol transactions as a percentage of total trading activity . the graphs for
each group represent a line plot of eol ' s weekly percentage of total trading
activity by deal count and volume over the last three months . the attachment
also contains source data on the second and third pages , which gives the
absolute numbers represented by the percentages shown on the graphs . these
sheets contain several additional commodity groups which have demonstrated a
decreasing or erratic eol trend , but were not graphed because they averaged
less than 10 - 15 total transactions ( both eol and non - eol ) per week .
a few notes on the four graphed commodity groups :
austrian power - the overall eol trend as a percentage of transactions in
austrian power has been upward over the last three months , despite the sharp ,
temporary decrease which took place at the end of july as a result of the
head austrian power trader and stack manager going on holiday . since his
return , the percentage has picked back up and as of 8 / 22 about 30 % of
austrian power trades were once again being done through eol . there is cause
for concern here , however , in the fact that the absence of one trader
effectively shut off eol trading in this commodity group .
lpg - the lpg products have followed a somewhat erratic path since inception ,
with eol transactions typically accounting for between 20 and 30 percent of
total lpg trading activity . this overall trend remains intact and as of 8 / 22 ,
eol accounted for 26 % of lpg trades .
crude & products - this commodity group has been demonstrating a steady
decline in eol trading activity over the last three months . while eol trades
accounted for approximately 20 % of all crude and products activity in may ,
this percentage has dropped off to just over 10 % as of august 22 nd . this
trend is particularly disturbing because of its consistancy , as well as the
relatively large data pool on which it is based .
uk power - although the absolute number of trades in uk power dropped off
significantly at the end of july , eol ' s percentage of uk power transactions
has remained fairly stable . eol ' s percentage of uk power trades "" spiked ""
briefly during the second week of june , but outside of this the percentage of
uk power trading represented by eol transactions has fluctuated between 20
and 40 percent . on trade date 8 - 22 , eol transactions accounted for just over
50 % of all transactions done in uk power .",ham,2000-08-25

as chuck mentioned in his voicemail , the purchase agreement for the general partnership interests in ponderosa pine energy partners , ltd . was executed earlier today and the transactions contemplated thereby are expected to close near the end of this month . an hsr filing is going to be made on monday and the legal teams for both parties intend to seek early termination of the 30 day waiting period in order to expedite the closing . el paso is going to seek board approval for the transaction during the week of september 17 th - 21 st and must deliver notice of board approval no later than september 21 st ( this is a minor change from the dash which identified the 19 th as the outside approval date ) .
one other very important item of which you must be aware is that el paso was very concerned about the confidentiality of this transaction and insisted that our agreement contain the following provision :
"" no party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers , employees , representatives , consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information , all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information . ""
please limit your disclosure of this transaction accordingly .

875,7033,re : hello from vince kaminski at enron,"vince
the audience consist of mostly first year graduate students in industrial
engineering and operations research some doctoral students and faculty . a
short introduction about opportunities for quantitative minded people at
enron would be good . it would also be good if in your talk you can give some
technical examples for people with a good analytic background but no much of
a financial engineering background . many of the first year graduate students
go for a masters degree and wonder what they can do with an or masters
degree .

876,12894,fw : credit watch list - - week of 9 / 17 / 01,"louise ,
i think that john ( see below ) raises a valid point regarding our credit dismissal of the airline industry . enron does a very good job "" wooing "" a sector doing good times , but as soon as the commercial operations get tough we dump like a hot potato . as such , when we will try to entertain the airline sector in the future to do risk management and hedging through enron , substantial ill will this from prior disposal will have been created . do we care ?
i have got to think that there should exist sufficient origination opportunities for companies going into bankruptcy - - maybe for lydecker ' s organization ?

jean ,
i am forwarding the credit watch list for your review . i have one concern as a member of the origination team ( "" no trades "" - - nine energy services , llc and all airline counterparties ( including but not limited to the following ) : air canada , airtran holdings , america west airlines , america west holdings corp . , american airlines , inc . , amr corp . , chautauqua airlines , continental airlines , delta air lines , jet blue airways , midway airlines , northwest airlines , sabina blanca sl , southwest airlines , united air lines , u . s . airways and the val group . ) i would hope that we are not just abandoning this segment of the industry . i know enron has been courting these counterparties for the last few years to hedge their energy needs . i hope we are doing whatever is possible to work through the financial issues . if enron is going to keep market share in this industry we need to think about how we manage the risk and retain the customers .

"" proposed generation webmap ""
this site was developed to support our in - house research of proposed gas - fired generation in north america . it has been met with great delight and is used heavily by our gas and power originators . basic fields in the proposed database include ( company name , pipeline , size , merchant capacity , comments , city , county , state , on - line year , month . . . ) .
http : / / nahou - wwmapolp / website / proposed
"" pseudo real - time available pipeline capacity map ""
this site was developed as a prototype , we basically took a pipe in the pacific northwest ' pgt ' and have linked to it available pipeline capacity for points along the pipeline . we have further plans to provide this for all the delivery / receipt point in the us . it has been a big hit and the traders are looking forward to having access to the entire system . fields in the database include ( pipe name , point name , total capacity , utilized capacity , available capacity ) the points are displayed by size according to the amount of available capacity that point holds . this one may take a minute to pull up .
http : / / nahou - wwmapolp / website / pgt
real - time container available map ""
this site was developed to support our freight capacity traders in "" enron global markets "" it reads freight capacity off of an external website and then displays that information on our website . again , the point ' s size is determined by the amount of capacity available at the point . if you identify the point you will see that the records are actually broken down by capacity type , the sum of these equals the total capacity of the points .
http : / / nahou - wwmapolp / website / rezl
"" diesel price map ""
this site was developed for the egs fundamentals group that study volatility of diesel prices in the u . s . the point colors represent the price / gallon of diesel at different locations in the u . s . the webmap is designed to read very similar to a weather map , with the cool colors representing lower prices and so - on and so - forth . the site also includes a delta price ( + or - number in blue ) this delta number is the change is diesel prices since the most recent monday . this allows the traders to analyze relative volatility of prices . i have also included a . pdf file that basically represents the same information .
http : / / nahou - wwmapolp / website / diesel
again , these are just some of the sites that we currently have up and running , we are currently developing a prototype for you to look at that has uk based energy related data , look for it in a couple of days . we have several other sites that we can show you at a later date if you are interested in them .

895,27897,tw bullets 8 / 11,"interactive open season - tw held its third ios of the year this week for
14 , 000 mmbtu / d of space from east of thoreau to pg & e topock . ten parties
originally registered to bid of which 7 actually participated . the high bid
was reliant at $ . 138 .
gallup compressor - a meeting was held with operations , regulatory , and
facility planning personnel to review the performance of the new compressor
station . currently , the vibration level has increased . the unit and lateral
efficiency are a continuing concern . operations plans to pull the unit apart
in early september for an evaluation . at this time , the anticipated 30 , 000
mmbtu / d of "" additional "" capacity we hoped to have is now not available .
there is also concern that we may be unable to meet our currently subscribed
ft obligation .
el paso all american - we attended the el paso pipeline meeting this week as
they described their ferc filing to begin the conversion of the all american
pipeline from oil to gas . they reiterated several times to attending
shippers that the project would not offer any incremental space to the main
line . el paso ' s filing centers around the cost and fuel savings from
decommissioning very old compressor equipment on their south system and
replacing the capacity with the all american line . the cost figures
( conversion and acquisition ) that el paso filed tracked very closely with
what transwestern estimated in its evaluation of the pipe . the in - service
date is expected to be july 1 , 2001 .
transport options - tw commercial reps met with marketing and regulatory
personnel from burlington resources , conoco , and texaco this week to review
the proposed transport options tariff filing . the meeting was very positive
and constructive . several suggestions were made that led to the realization
that the best course of action would be to delay the actual tariff filing and
have a working group meeting in the houston office . everyone agreed that as
much preliminary work as possible should be done before the filing to make
the whole process less contentious and to garner more customer support for
the tariff . we are trying to schedule the working group session for the
third week of august .
crawford lateral - a line leak on the lateral this week reduced flow from
50 , 000 mmbtu / d to zero . operations initially estimated 2 - 3 days of down time
but actually only required 12 hours . approximately 55 feet of line was
replaced .
el paso measurement letter - stan horton forwarded the "" mis - measurement ""
letter to el paso management this week . we will follow up in approximately
two weeks if they don ' t respond sooner .
operator imbalances - met with market services personnel to review operator
imbalances across tw ' s system . marketing is supportive of gas control ' s
efforts to limit the imbalances and begin allocations if operators schedule
gas and then can ' t deliver . with proactive balance management , there is
opportunity to realize greater park ' n ride revenue .

914,7989,"cera monthly oil briefing - cera alert - december 20 , 2000","title : cera monthly oil briefing : fundamentals update
e - mail category : cera monthly briefing
cera knowledge area : world oil
in the past two weeks , oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength
that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages
this winter . the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard
to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil
stock situation is at least stabilizing , even if stocks have not built
substantially , and that , thus far , despite a few weeks of colder - than - normal
temperatures , heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key
us market . that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving
speculative interest into the market . furthermore , the potential for weakness
in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001 .
the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that
iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide , yet , the iraqi export
cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals . if the cutoff lasts
through december , the effect will be pronounced - it would turn a projected
fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) into a
stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic
because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions , and
exports may again cease . at some point such a development would have a price
supportive effect .
cera ' s price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the world oil watch
released in late november . assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or
repeated shutdowns of iraqi production , the projected average for first
quarter 2001 is $ 29 per barrel for wti . however , this outlook is based on
opec ' s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its
production by the start of the second quarter . a failure to restrain output
would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $ 27 wti for the first
quarter of 2001 , with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in
the first . the downward pressure results from the prospect of a
larger - than - usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about
3 . 0 mbd - with a cut in opec output .
iraq in a twilight zone
as anticipated , iraq ceased exporting oil under the un - controlled "" oil for
food "" program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security
council ' s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule . *
iraq ' s pricing was judged by the un overseers , who monitor the export program
and advise the sanctions committee , to be about 60 cents per barrel below
comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that
iraq was seeking from buyers .
although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues , iraq partially
resumed exporting on december 13 . since then , about 1 mbd has been exported
from the mina al - bakr terminal in the persian gulf . prior to the shutdown ,
iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2 . 21 mbd for november , as
compared with 2 . 08 mbd for the third quarter . exports for november were about
1 . 3 mbd from mina al - bakr and about 0 . 9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean .
exports from ceyhan have not resumed , owing to the surcharge dispute , with
the result that about 1 . 2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market .
iraq ' s semi - shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its
dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues . ( in the midst of
this dispute , the un security council approved phase nine of the oil - for - food
program at the last minute on december 5 ; it became effective on december 6
and has been accepted by iraq ) . as of decemberl 9 , iraq ' s revised export price
for ceyhan , proposed for the remainder of december , has again been judged too
low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions
committee . additionally , the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude
that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow
account would be a violation of un sanctions . buyers of iraqi oil from mina
al - bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a
surcharge to iraq .
how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear , but it continues
to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an
apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are
the heart of the sanctions system . the distinction that iraq has made between
mina al - bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al - bakr by
loading two cargoes for the india oil company . iraq may have judged this
accommodation to be in its interest , since it recently also signed an oil
exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil . as
currently structured , the deal would violate un sanctions , but india is
seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic
hardship . the exception seems unlikely to be granted , which may lead iraq to
cease exports from mina al - bakr again .
there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow , but we expect
uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as
leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security
council to end all restraints . consequently , the iraq factor will remain an
element in the oil price outlook .
iraq ' s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq
issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take
office . secretary of state - designate colin powell has already acknowledged a
need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to "" reenergize ""
sanctions . the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign
policy - oriented think tank in washington . a consensus seems to be emerging
around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by
retaining un control over iraq ' s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a
prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general
trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international
irritant . there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to
destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that
the prospects for success are remote .
demand trends
record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for
gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so ,
and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas . interruptible gas
customers with resid or distillate fuel back - up have already switched to oil ,
so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the
already high level of distillate demand . so far in december us distillate
demand is running at a record high december level of 3 . 9 mbd . however , only a
small portion of this demand is the result of economically based
fuel - switching from gas to distillate . cera estimates that the additional
demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is
relatively small , on the order of 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mbd . in cera ' s view it is likely
that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short
notice because in some cases , this theoretically switchable capacity has not
been used in recent years , and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in
uncertain condition .
switching by interruptible gas customers ( such as utilities ) to distillate
began about a month or more ago , although the volumes involved are relatively
small . switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices
started to surge in the summer . a portion of the us secondary and tertiary
distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible
gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage . given the
expectations of a tight gas market , regulators have been explicit about
enforcing back - up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the
current heating season .
other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching .
some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost
of feedstock natural gas is high . natural gas is also used in some enhanced
oil recovery operations , and some of these producers have also opted to sell
gas back to the grid rather than produce oil .
supply trends
non - opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0 . 9 mbd over a
year earlier at 46 . 4 mbd . recent events include a shortfall in mexican
production , curtailed in october by about 300 , 000 bd owing to the effects of
hurricane keith . mexico ' s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be
3 . 64 mbd - about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity . norway ' s output
increased 200 , 000 bd from october to november as maintenance season ended .
norway ' s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3 . 53 mbd . *
growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a
recent surge in exports , in spite of higher export taxes . russian exports of
domestic oil production ( excluding transit volumes ) reached 2 . 5 mbd in
november , after remaining fairly steady at about 2 . 35 mbd from july though
october . fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2 . 5 mbd , 0 . 3 mbd
greater than in the fourth quarter 1999 .
cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2 . 91 mbd in november - down 0 . 1
mbd from the october level . the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced
iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0 . 8 mbd . iraq
resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13 , which raised production to
1 . 80 mbd . assuming no change in iraq ' s current production stance , iraqi
production would average 1 . 41 mbd for december . on a quarterly basis , the
decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth
quarter of 29 . 0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0 . 5
mbd into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . these production estimates include 0 . 15 mbd
of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un
authorization and are continuing .
oil stocks
us crude oil inventories ( doe data ) have climbed intermittently from an
annual low of 280 million barrels in september and reached 292 million
barrels in mid - december ( see figure 1 ) . since prices weakened in late
november , crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september
and the ranges seen in october to levels from 289 - 292 million barrels .
primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year - earlier levels ;
at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels , or 24 percent less , than
those of a year ago , but there are indications of builds in secondary and
tertiary inventories . we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up
5 - 10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at
the end of last year .
in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with
those of the united states . in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels
to 426 million barrels . at this level they are below the highs of 1999 but
well above the low levels of early 1996 ( see figure 2 ) . japanese crude oil
inventories at end - october were 107 . 6 million barrels , which is above the
record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent
years ( see figure 3 ) .

916,15787,greetings to you,"mrs . shirley yema gbujama
minister of social welfare ,
gender and children affairs
sierra leone
greetings to you ,
with warm heart i offer my friendship , and greetings ,
and i hope this mail meets you in good time . however
strange or surprising this contact might seem to you
as we have not met personally or had any dealings in
the past , i humbly ask that you take due consideration
of its importance and the immense benefit it will be
to you .
after careful consideration with my children , we
resolved to contact you for your most needed
assistance in this manner . i duly apologize
for infringing on your privacy , if this contact is not
acceptable to you , as i make this proposal to you as a
person of integrity .
first and foremost i wish to introduce myself properly
to you . my name is mrs . shirley yema gbujama , mother of
three and the minister of social welfare , gender and children
affairs and other ministeries for eight years running .
you may view my profile on the following link ;
i will now give you a general overview of the
situation . when i was sworn in as minister of social
welfare , gender and children affairs in 1996 , with my
influence , my husband mr . anthony gbujama , a very successful
businessman was awarded several contracts in my
ministry and had direct dealings with foreign
investors in this field . due to my political status , i
was not involved in my husband ' s business which was
very vast and successful . my beloved husband died
whilst on an official trip to one of his project sites , where
they were attacked by rebles and killed and their corpese were never found .
when my husband died , i was contacted as next of kin
by a private security firm in europe to come forth
with the certificate of deposit and claim a safety
deposit my husband has in their vault in his name . at
that time , my children and i did not have an idea
where the certificate might be . we then instructed the
security firm to continue holding the safety deposit
until further instructions from me . whilst preparing
for the second remembrance of my beloved husband , i
was going through his library collection and to my
astonishment i discovered a certificate of deposit for
the safety deposit with this private security firm ,
and other documents relating to the safety deposit in
a book . the safety deposit which is a trunk , is
stocked with hard currency ( us dollars ) totalling
$ 18 , 500 , 000 which was generated from cash payments
from his business associates in the diamond trade from
antwerp , belgium .
though i knew my late husband was in the diamond
business , i did not have the knowledge that he moved
funds in cash . this has came as a shock to me and my
children , and we have decided to have this fund
invested immediately in commercial and residential
properties abroad as well as profitable ventures , as
any member of my family cannot hold such a huge
amount in our name due to my political status , hence
we sincerely propose to you to render us your most
needed assistance in this regard .
if you agree to render us your assistance , your role
in this project will be to act on my behalf as a
trustee to receive the safety deposit containing the
funds from the security firm .
for your reliable assistance , we are offering you 15
% of the funds . i thank you in advance as
we anticipate your assistance in enabling us achieve
this goal . as you may understand , due to my sensitive position in the present
government , it is not safe to communicate with me via
phone or fax .
this is why i have communicated with you with my
private email address , and i like us to keep this way ,
for the safety of this transaction .
please contact me on my private email address ;
yemasfamily @ netscape . net
whether or not you are interested in assisting us .
this will enable us make alternative plans , in the
event of non - interest on your part .
with warm regards ,

931,12885,re : amendment to im ii ppa,"todd and louise ,
with respect to no . 1 below , i will check with mike curry to get his view on "" contract intent "" .
with respect to no . 2 and no . 3 , the answer is absolutely "" no "" as they are material changes to the contract that have significant value issues . since i personally requested these changes to the original contract ( in the negotiation process ) , i know what the contract intent was and continues to be .
if aep is still the equity buyer , they have complete control over the "" grid curtailment "" and associated termination risk in item no . 2 since they are the transmission owning utility in the region .
the total epmi ppa ( as of 9 / 17 cob ) value is currently $ 18 . 5 million . my estimate for ppa value erosion for amendments no . 2 and no . 3 is $ 8 - 10 million . obviously , the $ erosion value is somewhat subjective , however , the transmission risk / grid curtailment risk on this project is significant and the termination event for grid curtailment is essential to mitigate what could be substantial downside for epmi . the reason i had mike ensure this provision was in the current ppa was to shift some of that risk back to enron wind and now enron wind is trying to push it to the project lenders ( who also don ' t want the risk ) .

subject : re : amendment to im ii ppa
kevin ,
ewc requires three clarifications to the ppa in order to get the project financed and sold . all previously requested amendments proposed by the equity purchaser have been dropped , and ewc will take the resulting pricing reduction .
i want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are . these clarifications conform to the original deal and are not changes to the deal .
1 . banking provisions . ewc and epmi agreed that energy and renewable energy credits ( "" recs "" ) produced by the indian mesa ii wind generating facility in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would , on a cumulative basis , offset any deficiencies of energy and recs in subsequent years . section 4 . 04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carryover mechanism which was contemplated by the parties . ( this section originally provided for the carryover , but in an effort to simplify the language , the aggregate carryover concept was clouded . ) both the project lenders and the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified . there has never been a disagreement between epmi and ewc on the intention of the carryover banking provisions . epmi ' s most recent refusal to make this clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal
2 . grid curtailment ewc and epmi drafted the contract with specific provisions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment , section 5 . 04 . there is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covered under the termination provision relating to force majeure under section 5 . 02 . this inconsistency is the problem . neither ewc nor epmi were to pay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment . the proposed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of the ppa be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments . this clarification is consistent with the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal .
3 . epmi credit support . epmi ' s obligations under the ppa are guaranteed by enron . the indian mesa ii ppa permits epmi to assign the ppa to certain affiliates without consent of the seller . any assignment by epmi would not relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract , and the enron guarantee would remain in place . however , the project lenders have required clarification that the enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as enron corp ' s credit quality . the project lender ' s have also requested that the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any substitute ppa used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be with a party that had a credit quality similar to enron corp ' s , since that is the credit that is supporting the indian mesa ii ppa . this will not affect the value of the contract to a third party since enron bears this obligation unless released by the project .
under the dispute resolution provisions of the ppa we could certainly pursue declaratory relief under arbitration . our sense is that this does nothing but ensure delay .
from an enron perspective :
the sale of the equity and the financing of the non - recourse debt on the indian mesa ii project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrounding the ambiguities in the ppa
while the debt financing for the indian mesa i project is in place ( different offtaker ) the proposed equity sale to aep is linked to the sale of the indian mesa ii project .
if enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within the next month , enron will likely end up with approximately $ 153 m less cash at year end than it counted on in its plan , in addition to any decrease in planned earnings
the after - tax return to enron in a "" hold "" situation is 0 % , due to enron being in the alternative minimum tax position , i . e . it cannot use the tax benefits .
it was clear in the discussions with the city of san antonio that these clarifications would have had no affect on value .

i would like to make the message even more clear . epmi will not be making any changes , amendments , clarifications , interpretations , etc . to the current indian mesa ii ppa . therefore , any proposed purchaser of the indian mesa facility must evaluate the contract based on their own legal and commercial interpretation .
i don ' t think it is productive to spend any more time on this discussion . we will continue provide enron wind with the ppa value on a daily basis such that total shareholder value is maximized for any proposed wind transaction ( sale of company and / or sale of im project ) .
please feel free to call me to discuss ( 713 - 853 - 5035 )

we are not interested in these changes to the ppa . these changes will weaken the language in the contract for us ( i . e . improve it for aep that is probably why they are asking for the "" clarifications "" ) . i will be out next week on vacation so please address any further concerns in my absence to kevin presto . regards , - mike

mike : attached is our proposed amendment to the indian mesa ii ppa . it deals with the banking clarification ( section 4 . 04 amendments ) , grid curtailment clarification ( section 5 . 02 amendments ) , guaranty clarifications requested by the lenders ( section 5 . 05 and 9 . 03 amendments ) , and the ercot amendment ( section 3 . 04 amendments ) that we have discussed . please note that the ercot restriction would permit international sales , such as to mexico , but would otherwise restrict epmi ' s sales of energy from the wind facility to other locations within ercot . in the preparation of this draft , we used the same amendment that was previously sent to you by e - mail on 8 / 22 / 01 . that e - mail had a redline with it to show the changes to the banking provisions . please let us know whether this draft is acceptable or whether you have any questions or comments on the amendment . thanks

enron corp . drew down about $ 3 billion , the bulk of its available bank credit lines , in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity .
enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $ 1 . 85 billion of outstanding commercial paper - - short - term corporate ious - - according to a person familiar with the matter , with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion . some observers believe the move is a pre - emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted . the person also said enron was talking to its banks about a new , multibillion - dollar credit line .
enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong . but , "" when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days , we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank , "" said an enron spokesman . in a statement , the company ' s new chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , said that by drawing down the bank lines , "" we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments . ""
the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation ' s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday , for example , enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit .
since early last week , enron ' s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week , it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was replaced wednesday .
the draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency , fitch , put enron on review for a possible downgrade , while another , standard it takes time to sell assets , particularly in today ' s slower economy .
the company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility , particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow , the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official , who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings , a computerized search of the sec ' s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco .
chewco was established in 1997 "" with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments "" to buy an interest in enron assets , according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn ' t further specify what assets were purchased , and it didn ' t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper , a managing director in enron ' s global equity markets group , according to the document .
enron , which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed , didn ' t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco .
mr . kopper , who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships , didn ' t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco , an enron spokesman would say only that "" michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . "" mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july .
this statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k , a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 , 000 and involves "" any director or executive officer . "" by contrast , mr . fastow , as cfo , would have fallen into that category , but mr . kopper , as managing director of a business unit , presumably wouldn ' t have .
however , reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition , one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 , a related - party transaction involves a "" material "" piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors , top officers , vice presidents in charge of major business units and "" other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management .

officials at enron corp . , whose unusual transactions with its chief financial officer are under regulatory scrutiny , have steadily sold sizable amounts of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this year .
corporate officials had sold 1 . 8 million shares valued at about $ 106 million through july , as the stock fell to less than $ 45 a share from $ 83 at the start of the year . since july , the stock has plummeted an additional 63 % to $ 16 . 35 , including a 50 % plunge since the beginning of last week .
kenneth lay , chief executive of the houston energy - trading company , cashed in shares for $ 25 . 7 million so far this year , usually in transactions paired with options exercises . he sold 429 , 614 shares , leaving him with some 2 . 8 million shares as of july , the latest data available on his sales , according to thomson financial / lancer analytics .
the dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all mr . lay ' s sales of enron shares for 2000 , which reached $ 30 . 7 million . in 1999 , he sold shares for a total of $ 26 million .
in houston , an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures , saying the company doesn ' t keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate officials . enron also wouldn ' t comment on the number of options held by company insiders and called the sales "" a personal decision . "" many sales by enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises .
strong selling by company officers and directors amid share - price declines should raise red flags for investors , says jonathan moreland , research director of insiderinsights . com , who uses insider - trading data to zero in on investment ideas .
among other insiders selling during the year , kenneth rice , former chairman and ceo of enron ' s broadband unit , sold shares for $ 23 . 7 million . mr . rice has sold 456 , 966 shares of the 1 . 5 million shares he was listed as owning in enron ' s march proxy filing . former enron chief executive jeffrey skilling - - who resigned in august - - sold 160 , 000 shares for $ 9 . 8 million during the year . in march , mr . skilling owned 1 . 9 million shares .
messrs . rice and skilling couldn ' t be reached to comment .
overall , enron ' s insiders were busier selling shares last year , when they sold 5 . 8 million shares for about $ 449 million . during 1999 , insiders sold 3 . 4 million shares for $ 123 . 1 million .
since december 1999 , only one enron executive has reported buying company shares . the buyer was andrew fastow , who was ousted during the week as enron ' s chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial ties between the company and mr . fastow .
mr . fastow reported purchasing 10 , 000 enron shares in august at $ 36 . 98 each , or a total of $ 369 , 800 . today , those shares are valued at $ 163 , 500 , based on enron ' s stock price of $ 16 . 35 in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading . after the purchase , mr . fastow owned 110 , 586 shares , thomson financial / lancer analytics says .
enron said mr . fastow wasn ' t available to comment .
on monday , a new york law firm filed suit in u . s . district court in houston , alleging that enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by mr . fastow . the suit , which seeks class - action status , also says enron insiders sold $ 73 million of their own enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001 .

credit markets
enron ' s financial troubles reverberate to bonds with poor liquidity and credit - rating concerns

new york - - enron corp . ' s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse .
not for long , some bond traders say .
in trading yesterday , the houston company ' s five - year bond , a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % , was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar , down from a bid of 88 late wednesday , and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks .
that is far less than the 50 % decline in enron ' s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments , resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond ' s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds , which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit , that kind of "" spread "" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower .
enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound , disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline , investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday ' s 82 bid , for instance , was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds , a small percentage of a typical trade .
fueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles , including losses , a securities and exchange commission investigation , and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer .
"" even at these levels , there ' s very little buying interest , "" said harold rivkin , a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton , n . j .
in one sign of the ripple effects , the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a "" default swap "" - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier , and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company ' s troubles earlier during the year .
even with its woes , enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron ' s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level .
yet fitch said yesterday it put enron ' s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade , following a similar move by moody ' s investors service last week . ( standard & poor ' s , a division of mcgraw hill cos . , stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list , opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to "" negative , "" citing concerns about the company ' s financial flexibility . )
meanwhile , the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . "" these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels , "" said glenn reynolds , an analyst at credit sights inc . , an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . "" they aren ' t distressed yet , but they are headed in that direction . ""
if enron ' s credit ratings fall , it would have implications far beyond the company ' s ability to raise money . for an energy trader , a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments .
enron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas , the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber , metals , bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers , enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation ' s energy and gas markets .
enron ' s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating , the cheaper it can hedge , or offset , its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating , the cost of this high - margin , high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to , or derived from , that of an underlying security or asset , such as a stock , bond or commodity .
"" even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating , the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses , "" said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc . "" any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron ' s counterparties "" - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - - "" is going to be examining their exposure to enron , and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it , "" mr . reynolds said .
to be sure , enron , despite its recent woes , remains a strong company , credit analysts said . "" i don ' t think anyone ' s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default , "" mr . reynolds said .
"" so far , our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them , "" said ron barone , managing director of standard & poor ' s utility energy project finance group . "" no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified . and customers have publicly stated that it ' s business as usual . ""
yet analysts say the arrival of distressed - debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for enron and its management . traders expect enron ' s new chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon and chairman kenneth lay to make the rounds of wall street next week , meeting with rating agencies , debt - trading desks , big bond holders and banks , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc .
treasurys
treasurys rallied on optimism that the federal reserve may cut interest rates more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that documented how weak the economy was after the sept . 11 terrorist attacks .
prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week ' s flood of treasury , corporate and agency debt issues .
at 4 p . m . edt , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was up 13 / 32 point , or $ 4 . 0625 per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 103 20 / 32 . its yield fell to 4 . 537 % from 4 . 588 % wednesday , as yields move inversely to prices .
the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price was up 22 / 32 point at 101 11 / 32 to yield 5 . 284 % , down from 5 . 330 % wednesday .
fed policy makers are slated to meet on nov . 6 . also providing support for longer maturities , the treasury department made another repurchase of issues outstanding . it received offers for $ 5 . 04 billion in callable 30 - year bonds , of which it accepted $ 1 billion . the offer - to - cover ratio , an indication of demand , was 5 . 04 .

heard on the street
most analysts remain plugged in to enron

enron : rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about .
in recent years , wall street researchers have been overwhelmingly - - critics would say blindly - - enthusiastic about enron , even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits . now , enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions , which many on wall street still can ' t figure out .
in a research note wednesday , goldman sachs analyst david fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company . the company ' s "" lack of disclosure and transparency , "" he says , is "" a longstanding enron hallmark . ""
so is this a stock to avoid , in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its "" u . s . select list , "" which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm ' s larger but prestigious "" recommended list "" of 200 or so favored stocks , where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 .
"" just because i can ' t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn ' t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can ' t analyze it ' or ` i can ' t figure it out , ' "" says mr . fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . "" if that were the case , there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn ' t follow . ""
enron ' s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week .
"" every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box , "" says jim chanos , principal of kynikos associates in new york , who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year . "" it was really a trust - me story , when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . ""
true , no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias , particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had .
but enron stands apart , precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company ' s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company ' s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ?
concerns about the way that enron runs its business aren ' t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron ' s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again , wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company ' s various partnership transactions .
besides those partnerships , enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings .
through it all , most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling , publicly dismissing questions about the firm ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday , of the 17 analysts who following the stock , 10 had a "" strong buy "" or equivalent rating on the stock , according to thomson financial / first call . five others rated the stock a "" buy , "" though not strongly .
only prudential securities , which downgraded the stock this week , has a "" sell "" rating on enron .
the bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance , despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted .
over the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index ' s general collapse , analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who , like goldman ' s mr . fleischer , own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue .
enron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance , for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston , enron retained seven co - managers , including donaldson lufkin & jenrette , lehman brothers and merrill lynch .
"" enron is a big company , and i don ' t think you ' re going to find a firm that hasn ' t been involved , "" says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer , who still rates the stock a "" strong buy "" with a $ 40 price target . "" they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street . ""
he adds , "" we do our analysis every day based on the information we have . are we here strictly to defend companies ? that ' s ludicrous . we ' re here to provide information to investors . . . . yes , i have the wrong recommendation on the stock . i don ' t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed . ""
mr . fleischer , whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron , calls his holding "" a meaningful investment "" that is "" not small . "" but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised . mr . fleischer says his clients "" are happy to know "" he has a stake in enron , because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is .
in his research note wednesday , mr . fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron ' s off - balance sheet partnerships . despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company , he wrote that he and many other investors historically "" have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings "" and position as an industry leader .
"" there ' s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they ' re going to make their money , but every quarter they do , "" he says . "" it ' s hard to get inside to know all the transactions , but they do deliver . ""
csfb ' s mr . launer also has been a longtime defender of the company , occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press . on monday , he wrote that he expects questions about enron ' s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue , but that he remains "" confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [ enron ] and an ultimate recovery in the share price . ""
"" i know i ' m wrong on the stock , "" mr . launer says . but he says that at these prices , he isn ' t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst - case scenario - - under which he envisions enron having to issue as much as $ 2 billion worth of shares , diluting current holders - - the stock doesn ' t have much further to fall .
clearly , messrs . launer and flesicher aren ' t alone . "" even in relative terms , analysts remain very bullish on this stock , "" says chuck hill , director of research at thomson financial / first call . the average rating for a stock on wall street is 2 . 2 , or slightly shy of a "" buy "" rating . enron scores a 1 . 6 . "" this may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out , "" mr . hill says .
in downgrading the stock this week , prudential analyst carol coale bumped it to "" sell "" from "" buy , "" with a brief stop at "" hold . "" while she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock , she openly concedes her recent downgrades come "" too little , too late . ""
ms . coale says enron has been difficult to cover for years . she says the company ' s disclosure practices fall far short of ideal , and senior executives are often evasive , even when presented with direct questions . for instance , she says three weeks ago she asked enron management if the company was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . they said "" no , "" she says .
in light of the company ' s acknowledgment this week of an sec "" inquiry , "" she asked enron about the previous denial . "" they told me it is an inquiry , not an investigation , "" she says . an enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the sec ' s inquiry only last wednesday .

action by enron halts stock ' s fall
but credit ratings are being reviewed
by laura goldberg
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
the recent freefall of enron corp . ' s stock price stabilized thursday , a day after the world ' s largest energy trader replaced its chief financial officer .
enron , under a cloud for a number of reasons , including an securities and exchange commission inquiry , also made two announcements thursday night aimed at reassuring the financial community .
in the announcements , enron said it had drawn more than $ 1 billion from its lines of credit and said that energy - trading business done through enrononline on thursday was above average levels .
houston - based enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it , a spokeswoman said .
"" we are making it clear that enron has the full support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business , "" jeff mcmahon , who took over wednesday as chief financial officer , said in a written statement .
enron said it recorded more than 8 , 300 transactions through enrononline on thursday .
ken lay , chairman and chief executive officer , said : "" enron continues to be the market - maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets , our customers continue to put their confidence in us , and our core businesses are strong and performing well . ""
earlier thursday , two credit rating agencies took actions regarding enron ' s ratings , which j . p . morgan securities analyst anatol feygin described as "" just more negative sentiment . ""
at one point in thursday morning trading on the new york stock exchange , shares in enron were up more than $ 1 . 50 , but they closed down 6 cents at $ 16 . 35 . as recently as oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 .
before the market closed , international credit - rating agency fitch put enron , which currently holds investment - grade credit ratings , on review for a possible downgrade . then after the market closed , standard & poor ' s took two steps : it affirmed enron ' s current ratings , but it also revised its long - term ratings outlook to negative .
moody ' s investors service put all of enron ' s long - term debt on review for potential downgrade last week .
enron , which noted that losing its investment - grade rating would take downgrades of three notches , said thursday it will do everything in its power to defend its current rating .
in the sec inquiry , federal securities regulators are reviewing transactions between enron and two private investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , who was removed as enron ' s chief financial officer wednesday . enron removed fastow as part of its bid to repair its damaged credibility .
wall street is also questioning certain of enron ' s financing vehicles and is wondering whether the company will face hits to its balance sheet in the months ahead .
s & p said it was concerned that the sizable drop in enron ' s market capitalization has negatively affected its financial flexibility and could hurt the company ' s plans to rebuild its balance sheet .
but it also noted that the "" fundamental strength "" of enron ' s energy marketing and trading business has remained steady .
unless enron ' s rebuilds confidence among investors and business partners , fitch said , it could "" impair enron ' s financial flexibility and access to capital markets , "" which would hurt its ability to conduct business .
carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , said the actions by s source : world reporter ( tm )
battered corporate america will receive an immediate dollars 25 bn ( pounds 18 bn ) tax rebate under a dollars 100 bn eocnomic stimulation package just approved by the republican - controlled house of representatives .
the controversial package , worth an estimated dollars 212 bn over three years , includes dollars 70 bn for companies next year alone . it was approved by the house late on wednesday by 216 votes to 214 , but faces significant amendment in the senate , which is now under democrat control .
it has reopened a wide ideological rift between republicans , who favour corporate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession , and democrats - who , in a reprise of the roosevelt "" new deal "" , prefer to see increased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects .
liberal lobby groups such as the citizens for tax justice and the center on budget and policy priorities claim the bill would hand back dollars 6 . 3 bn to the 14 biggest corporations - which , they say , are renowned for paying little or no tax .
the most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax , or amt , introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments . this , strongly supported by president bush , would be made retroactive so that all amt payments would be refunded .
the lobby groups and the non - partisan congressional research service calculate that this would give a dollars 1 . 4 bn boost to computer group ibm alone , while general motors would get back dollars 833 m and general electric dollars 671 m .
others to benefit include txu , the texas - based utility that is the us ' s third largest energy supplier , which would would be given dollars 608 m . united airlines , the us ' s second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy - would receive dollars 371 m , and enron , the energy trading group forced to sack its finance director this week , would be given dollars 254 m .
democrat leaders in the senate are determined to erase this measure and dislike other proposals to boost firms , which include a 30 % tax break for capital investment over three years worth dollars 39 . 3 bn this year alone . they say these amount to a "" giant corporate giveaway "" .
mr bush and other republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would help companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay - offs and invest more , prompting an economic recovery that , at best , is likely to start in the new year .
"" businesses are america ' s employers . they ' re the hardware store , the diner down the street , the gas station on the corner . they ' re not the enemy of working families , "" the author of the plan , representative bill thomas of california , said .
democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package ' s provisions for the growing numbers of jobless , arguing that much of the dollars 12 bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of states .
* a fresh round of global trade talks is essential to revitalise the world economy after the terrorist attacks on the us , trade secretary patricia hewitt said yesterday , writes charlotte denny
as a new report predicted that global trade growth will collapse this year , ms hewitt warned that the world must not retreat into protectionism or isolationism in the wake of the attacks . wto trade ministers are gathering in doha , qatar , in two weeks ' time to discuss launching a new round of talks , the first since the collapse of their meeting in seattle , nearly two years ago .

harvey pitt ' s s . e . c . : from guard dog to friendly puppy ?

c . 2001 new york times company
can the new , friendlier securities and exchange commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy ?
harvey l . pitt , the new s . e . c . chairman , set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor , arthur levitt . in a speech to the american institute of certified public accountants - - an organization whose senior leadership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against mr . levitt ' s reform efforts - - mr . pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at his predecessor .
from now on , he promised , ' ' the commission will make sound decisions , in a respectful , affirmative way , not in a demeaning , demanding or demonizing way . ' ' he spoke favorably of ' ' pro forma ' ' earnings reports , in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty . there was no mention of mr . levitt ' s concerns about improper management of earnings .
on the heels of mr . pitt ' s speech , the s . e . c . used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors . the decision itself was reasonable , although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years . but the way the s . e . c . trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog . ' ' is this amnesty for financial fraud ? ' ' jane adams , the accounting analyst at credit suisse first boston and a former s . e . c . staff member , asked in a report to clients . she was not sure of the answer .
in an interview yesterday , mr . pitt dismissed such worries . ' ' no one is going to get away with anything , ' ' he said . ' ' what we are trying to do is create an environment where people feel comfortable ' ' and can talk to the s . e . c . ' ' without feeling we are looking for a big splash . ' '
a major embarrassment for accountants is having the s . e . c . force a client to restate its numbers . mr . pitt and his chief accountant , robert herdman , are sending signals that fewer such demands will be made . ' ' i am very much in favor of a vigorous enforcement program , ' ' mr . pitt said in the interview , ' ' but i am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting statements and restatements . ' '
mr . pitt talks of companies ' ' getting it right the first time , ' ' which would certainly be nice . but there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting , figuring there will be no real penalty , like a restatement , if they are caught . that would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting .
in trying to sound comforting to the accountants ' group - - an organization that , as he noted , he had represented as a lawyer for two decades - - mr . pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence .
the proof , of course , will come in the performance . fortunately , the mess at enron gives the s . e . c . a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image . it will take time for the commission to determine if the company ' s accounting was proper . but there need be no delay in forcing enron to clearly explain - - rather than obfuscate as it has so far - - the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer .
' ' this could , ' ' a former s . e . c . staff member said , ' ' focus the issue on whether companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosures . ' ' and it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite .

enron draws down at least 1 bln usd from credit lines to boost mkt confidence
10 / 26 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
houston ( afx ) - enron corp said it drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of 1 bln usd as part of moves to restore market confidence in the company .
"" we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business , "" said newly appointed chief financial officer jeff mcmahon .
"" this is an important step in our plan to restore investor confidence in enron . additionally , we will update investors over the next several days regarding our plans to maintain our long - term credit rating . ""
according to the wall street journal , enron drew down about 3 bln usd and will use part of the money to offer to redeem about 1 . 85 bln usd of outstanding commercial paper , with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion . the newspaper cited a person familiar with the matter .
it quoted observers as saying the move may be is a pre - emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted .
the source also said enron is talking to its banks about a new , multi - billion - dollar credit line .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones let ' s have a comfortable war
sure , we ' re at war with a band of cave - dwelling outlaws hell bent on our annihilation . but would all freedom - loving americans please go out and buy some dvd players ? maybe even a nice new car ?
that was basically the message from the treasury department , on news that congress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism efforts and rebuilding following the attacks . officials at treasury applauded the sentiment , then politely suggested it would be even better for the economy if americans just went to stores and bought stuff . "" the economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists , "" says betsy holahan , a department spokesperson . "" war bonds are an additional way for americans to show their patriotism . ""
for the record , we don ' t think an issue of war bonds would be dumb , just superfluous . after all , nothing ' s stopped americans from buying generic savings bonds - - or better yet , treasuries - - all of which finance spending by the federal government .
in the meantime , it ' s a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds - - which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice - - at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop . war bonds notwithstanding , we ' re a long way off from the era of ration books .
3 . enron again
last week , we noted the extent of alarm about enron ' s ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $ 1 . 2 billion , following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high - level transactions . following that disclosure , besieged cfo andrew fastow has finally left the company on what ' s delicately termed a "" leave of absence . ""
in july , fastow exited a limited partnership , from which he had reportedly reaped large profits , after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement . concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence .
but that won ' t be an easy task , given the resentment about enron ' s disinclination to explain its problems . one analyst called fastow ' s departure "" unsettling , "" noting that management had given the cfo its endorsement only the day before . sounding a note of exasperation , analysts at j . p . morgan chase , banc of america securities and prudential all downgraded the stock . and there could be more trouble to come : the securities and exchange commission has issued enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions .
4 . gold diggers
it ' s understandable that investors felt panicky in september . unfortunately , some reacted by shoving their hard - earned money into gold funds . according to financial research corp . , which tracks fund flows , the specialty precious - metals category was the best - selling equity category during september , with net inflows of $ 101 million .
granted , that ' s not a huge sum in the mutual fund world . by comparison , during the same month , large growth funds saw net redemptions of $ 7 . 4 billion . but the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy , given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long .
sure , under the bizarre circumstances of late , they ' ve enjoyed somewhat of a pop . according to morningstar , the average precious - metals fund is up 10 . 08 % year to date . but over the past five years , the same category lost an embarrassing 14 . 68 % . by comparison , even large - cap growth funds - - everybody ' s favorite whipping boy - - managed to post a positive return . in the same period , they were up 7 . 13 % .
moreover , circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades - - a combination of attacks on the u . s . government and war - - still don ' t seem to have boosted gold prices significantly . despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks , they ' re again approaching their pre - sept . 11 levels . it ' s too early to say , but it ' s likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again .
5 . amazon amazes once again
amazon ( amzn : nasdaq - news - commentary ) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter . well , at least it will post a pro forma operating profit .
ok , so maybe that wouldn ' t include amazon ' s service on $ 2 . 17 billion in long - term debt or extraordinary charges . in fact , a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy , meaningless aura of minor triumph . the company still hasn ' t said when it will turn an economic profit .
for that matter , even the fourth - quarter prediction is iffy . after announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit , cfo warren jenson added the humble qualifier , "" there are no guarantees . "" amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth - quarter revenue , predicting that sales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10 % compared with a year ago .
third - quarter trends weren ' t encouraging . though sales overall were up slightly in the third quarter from a year ago , revenue from the company ' s core books and music business actually fell 12 % . at least the company has made progress in cutting costs : a spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses have decreased by 20 % over the past year .
incidentally , in the wake of amazon ' s earnings report , two analysts made the belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock , which has fallen 93 % from its high back in december 1999 . merrill lynch analyst henry blodget and sg cowen analyst scott reamer downgraded the stock to "" neutral "" from previous buy ratings . "" we thought there might be upside to our estimates , "" noted blodget . "" there wasn ' t . ""

enron taps $ 3 billion from bank lines in pre - emptive move to ensure liquidity
10 / 25 / 2001
dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
embattled enron corp . drew down about $ 3 billion , the bulk of its available bank credit lines , in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity , friday ' s wall street journal reported .
enron ( ene ) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $ 1 . 85 billion in outstanding commercial paper - - short - term corporate ious - - according to a person familiar with the matter , with the remainder used to provide a cash cushion . this person also said that enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion - dollar credit line . some observers thought the moves were a pre - emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted .
enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong . but "" when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days , we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank , "" said an enron spokesman . in a prepared statement , the company ' s new chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , said that by drawing down the bank lines , "" we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments . ""
the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading firm in the past 10 days . enron is the nation ' s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . thursday , for example , enron was involved in about $ 4 billion worth of deals through its enrononline unit .
since early last week , enron ' s share price has plummeted 50 % . it has reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities run by its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was replaced wednesday .
the draw - down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency , fitch , put enron on review for a possible downgrade while standard & poors changed enron ' s credit outlook to negative from stable . moody ' s investors service has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade . in order to fall below investment grade , enron ' s credit rating would have to fall several notches .
if that were to happen , however , a host of bad consequences could follow . together with the sharp decline in its stock price , a noninvestment grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings . in that event , enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt , diluting the value of existing shares . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were down six cents at $ 16 . 35 .

dallas ( ap ) - kenneth lay , the chairman and chief executive of embattled enron corp . , has resigned from the board of software company i 2 technologies .
"" this is a very painful decision , "" lay said in a statement issued thursday by dallas - based i 2 technologies . "" but now that i am again taking on the ceo responsibilities at enron , i must reduce my outside activities . ""
lay resumed the chief executive ' s job at enron in august after jeff skilling surprised investors by leaving the houston - based energy company .
enron officials did not immediately return calls from the associated press .
in the past week , enron has been rocked by questions surrounding partnerships that did business with enron while they were managed by the company ' s chief financial officer . the official was replaced on tuesday .
enron ' s stock price has fallen nearly 50 percent since interest in the partnerships intensified , and the company acknowledged that the u . s . securities and exchange commission was investigating the arrangements
i 2 makes software to help companies manage their supply chains , and its clients include texas instruments , ford motor co . and dell computer corp .
i 2 stock plunged nearly 25 percent on oct . 17 after the company reported a $ 5 . 53 billion third - quarter loss and said it would cut 1 , 000 jobs , about one - fifth of the work force .
lay joined the board in october 2000 . no replacement was announced .
in trading thursday , i 2 shares rose 24 cents to $ 4 . 95 , and enron shares fell 6 cents to $ 16 . 35 .

as enron ' s woes unnerve investors about energy sector , analysts say its problems are isolated

copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved .
new york ( ap ) - as it grew over the past decade into the country ' s largest natural gas and power marketing company , enron corp . became the de facto barometer of health within the energy trading sector .
wall street buoyed the stock prices of enron ' s competitors based in part on the huge success of the houston - based company ' s business model . now , executives and industry analysts hope to prevent enron ' s internal tumult and free - falling stock price from undermining investors ' confidence in the sector . they say the houston - based company ' s problems should be viewed in isolation and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace .
"" the marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday , a week ago or a month ago , "" said jim donnell , president of duke energy north america , a division of duke energy corp . that generates and trades power .
that opinion appeared to gain acceptance on thursday as shares of dynegy inc . , el paso corp . and duke energy corp . rebounded from losses on wednesday , when enron ' s latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of its rivals .
enron ' s stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week ( and nearly 80 percent since january ) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytime soon .
the latest troubles began oct . 16 when enron reported third quarter earnings , and a longtime concern among wall street analysts that executives were not entirely forthcoming only got worse .
first came reports that some of the company ' s losses stemmed from partnerships managed by enron ' s chief financial officer at the time , andrew fastow . that raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission .
then on wednesday , one day after enron chairman kenneth lay defended fastow , the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence .
"" they created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn ' t come through with flying colors , "" said christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group in new york .
enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old , which have little to do with the company ' s wholesale energy business , which accounts for roughly 80 percent of profits .
analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices .
"" even though ( enron ) shot themselves in the foot , the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear , "" ellinghaus said .
ubs warburg analyst ronald barone echoed that sentiment .
"" the collateral damage to the rest of the space - dynegy and el paso - is overdone , "" barone said .
on thursday , williams companies inc . of tulsa , okla . , reported net income of $ 760 million and reliant resources inc . of houston reported $ 133 million in profits .
"" it ' s business as usual , "" said dynegy spokesman steve stengel .
not for enron , whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india and the surprise departure in august of then - chief executive jeff skilling was considered another bad sign .
on oct . 16 , enron reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . excluding the charge , enron earned $ 393 million on $ 47 . 6 billion in revenues for the three months ending sept . 30 .
ellinghaus said the stocks of enron ' s competitors were brought down wednesday because of "" dire "" speculation that enron ' s troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as duke and dynegy .
"" all i ' m hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality , "" ellinghaus said .
enron did not return calls seeking comment thursday .
donnell of duke energy said the charlotte , n . c . - based company is paying close attention to the enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid .
"" they continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to credit , "" he said . "" they ' ve never missed a deadline . ""

enron ' s credit outlook downgraded to negative by s & p ( updatel )
( adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph . )
houston , oct . 25 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s long - term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
standard & poor ' s after the largest energy trader ' s shares fell
49 percent in the past week .
s & p affirmed the houston - based company ' s ratings of
` ` bbb + / a 2 , ' ' which are investment grade .
the ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that enron won ' t generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt . s & p did
say that ` ` the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit - positive in the wake of recent management
changes . ' '
enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas . chief financial officer andrew
fastow resigned yesterday as the u . s . securities and exchange
commission asks for information about related - party transactions
he conducted .
` ` the s & p write up was very positive , ' ' said dorothea
matthews , an analyst at creditsights inc . , a research firm . ` ` it
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down . ' '
shares of enron fell 6 cents to $ 16 . 35 .

enron ' s trading partners say it ' s business as usual ( update 2 )
( adds new enron cfo in 14 th paragraph . )
houston , oct . 25 ( bloomberg ) - - concerns enron corp . will run
short on cash haven ' t prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker , customers say .
the company handles about 25 percent of u . s . power and
natural - gas trading , said john kilduff , vice president of energy
risk management for fimat usa . it ' s also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices .
enron ' s credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
moody ' s investors service , and standard & poor ' s lowered enron ' s
long - term credit outlook to negative after $ 1 . 01 billion in third -
quarter losses from some soured investments . the company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions .
so far , there are no signs that houston - based enron is
handling less business , kilduff said .
` ` if they were unable to perform , it would be a major
problem , ' ' he said . ` ` it could get like long - term capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big . ' '
long - term capital management , a private investment fund for
the wealthy , incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 russian currency crisis . the fund ' s portfolio plunged . more
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $ 3 . 6 billion
to avoid a collapse .
needs cash daily
enron trades electricity , natural gas , coal and other
commodities worldwide , as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods .
` ` as of now , enron is active in the markets , ' ' kilduff said .
` ` no one is cutting trading lines that i can see , or demanding
different terms than before . ' '
companies that trade as heavily as enron require cash every
day to settle positions , said kilduff , whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with enron .
some days , fimat will bet that natural - gas prices will fall ,
while enron bets that they will rise . natural gas usually does one
or the other every day , and someone pays the difference .
` ` the liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor , ' '
kilduff said . ` ` someone is paying someone else every day . ' '
enron said on a conference call tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally , and can fall back on $ 3 . 4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary . the company is determined to
protect the credit rating , enron has said .
` ` we aren ' t even going to entertain worst - case scenarios at
this point , ' ' said enron spokeswoman karen denne .
investor questions
enron , based in houston , ousted chief financial officer
andrew fastow yesterday , two days after the u . s . securities and
exchange commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares . those trades cost enron $ 35
million . jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets unit ,
replaced fastow , who went on leave of absence .
enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week . they
fell 6 cents to $ 16 . 35 today .
based on bloomberg composite ratings , most of enron ' s long -
term debt is rated at bbb 2 and bbbl , two or three levels above
investment grade . fitch , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s all rate
the company ' s debt at investment grade .
the company also faces questions from investors about $ 3 . 3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell enron assets such as power plants .
the affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets . enron doesn ' t know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt . the company would have to make good
on any shortfall .

enron asked citicorp inc . on tuesday to arrange a $ 750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets .
enron had about $ 1 . 85 billion of commercial paper , or short -
term unsecured debt , outstanding as of tuesday , traders said . the
company , which has a $ 3 billion program , has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the sec
investigation was announced , the traders said .
today , enron offered two - week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield , 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies .
` ` there appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order , ' ' said jon kyle cartwright ,
senior energy credit analyst at raymond james in dry seasons , when the dams
can ' t operate as well , enron pays the district .
` ` if enron ' s credit went bad , or they folded up , that
agreement wouldn ' t get picked up by someone else , ' ' tracy said .
enron also helps many u . s . utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall . any impairment on enron ' s part to continue doing so
would trickle down to main street utilities , tracy said .
` ` utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings , ' ' tracy said .

( copyright ( c ) 2001 , pr newswire )
philadelphia , oct . 25 / prnewswire / - - the law firm of spector , roseman ( ii ) that the company ' s operating results were materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write - down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the company ' s chief financial officer ; and ( iii ) that enron was failing to write - down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with gaap . on october 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market by announcing that the company was taking non - recurring charges of $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , in the third quarter of 2001 , the period ending september 30 , 2001 . subsequently , enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by enron ' s chief financial officer and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . during the class period , enron insiders disposed of over $ 73 million of their personally held enron common stock to unsuspecting investors .

enron employees watch options devalue as shares fall ( correct )
2001 - 10 - 25 18 : 41 ( new york )
enron employees watch options devalue as shares fall ( correct )
( company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph . )
houston , oct . 25 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year . now , from the boardroom to the mailroom ,
employees are sharing the pain .
enron , the largest energy trader , grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20 , 000 employees . under enron ' s standard compensation
package , most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary , spokeswoman meredith
philipp said .
employees held 46 . 8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000 , all at average prices above the company ' s current share
price . the stock has dropped 80 percent this year .
` ` virtually every option is under water right now , ' ' enron
spokeswoman karen denne said .
enron ' s board sets the strike price for the options in
december or january . employees can ' t cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price . at
the end of 2000 , enron shares were trading at $ 83 . 13 . in december ,
the board set a strike price of about $ 80 .
shares of houston - based enron fell 6 cents to $ 16 . 35 today .
they have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week .
enron said monday that the securities and exchange commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by andrew fastow , who
was ousted as enron ' s chief financial officer yesterday . one
partnership cost the company $ 35 million , and enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $ 1 . 2 billion .
enron named jeff mcmahon , head of its industrial markets
group , as cfo late yesterday .
unvested options
another 96 . 1 million options granted to enron employees
hadn ' t vested as of the end of last year . about 15 . 4 million of
them , or 16 percent , were at prices ranging from $ 6 . 88 to $ 20 a
share . the rest vest at levels well above the current share price .
experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries , such as technology and telecommunications , say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options .
` ` it looks bad , ' ' said mark edwards , chairman of iquantic
buck , a mellon financial corp . unit that provides compensation
consulting . ` ` employees look at ( the stock price ) every day , and
it ' s a continued disincentive to them . ' '
while denne said enron doesn ' t have any plans to reprice its
employees ' options , the company did issue a one - time stock option
grant at $ 36 . 88 in august , when ken lay resumed his former role as
the company ' s chief executive . lay , who had held the job for 15
years , turned the position over to jeffrey skilling in february .
skilling quit in august , citing family reasons .
the august grant , which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees ' base salary , didn ' t require a vesting period , but was
exercisable immediately . enron ' s shares haven ' t closed above
$ 36 . 88 since aug . 29 .

executive summary :
? cpuc direct access vote
cpuc
link to ? live webcast of cpuc meeting 10 : 00 am - @ : pm sept . 20 th
the sun may be setting on californians ' right to customer choice as the cpuc debates the fate of direct access today . we estimate that at this time , the cpuc commissioners will not be taking up the da issue and will instead delay the vote until after the legislature has convened the third special session , called by gov . davis last week . currently , both commissioners brown and wood appear unwilling to support da ; with president lynch being a swing vote .
concerning the retroactive suspension of direct access agreements of customers who have already elected alternate service providers , the current cpuc position appears to be that direct access contracts signed by september 20 th , 2001 will not be nullified . there is rumor that the cpuc may be reviewing several of the contracts signed within the past three to nine months . many commercial consumers now operating under da are highly pessimistic about the cpuc supporting da agreements that have been signed within the past three months . the business community is very conscience that the cpuc now bears the difficult task of weighing california businesses ' political and economic interests against the economic interests of california ' s residential power consumers .

hello mike ,
i work in rodney malcolm ' s commercial transaction group , focusing on
developing energy management relationships with large volume industrial
energy consumers . due to the volatility and high price levels of the natural
gas contract , these consumers of natural gas are extremely concerned about
this exposure , and they are asking for our assistance in helping them manage
this exposure . one of the tools that these customers are requesting is
technical analysis of the natural gas contract so as to determine entry
points for their hedges .
to the extent you could assist us with this analysis , we can proactively
meet these customer requests and increase our deal flow .
please advise as to the availability of your assistance .

i ' d like to give a talk entitled "" diagrammatic representation of real options
in enron "" , in which i will give a brief run - down of a diagrammatic technique
i have developed for representing real option deals . my notation allows
originators , managers and quants to communicate unambiguously , while still
appreciating the complexity and subtlety of real optionality . i have defined
a "" diagrammatic grammar "" which guarantees that the pricing of the deal
follows immediately and automatically from the diagram .
i propose to introduce the symbols and grammar , then go on to present some
suitable examples of diagrams . if appropriate i ' ll talk about the links with
dynamic programming . ( i will need some guidance as to how much technical
detail i can go into based on the audience . )

the a / a program does not have a contract in place with melly language

as i mentioned earlier , if i continue with my current tutor , but outside of

ivonne ,
i am currently enrolled in a french language class thru enron and melly ' s
language services , and my group is paying the cost directly .
i am considering quitting the melly ' s language program in favor of an outside
private tutor , for a number of reasons . it will be cheaper too .
i would like to know :
1 . does enron have a contract in place with melly ' s language service , to be
the exclusive provider of language services to enron ?
2 . will enron pay the costs of my language classes if they are held outside
of the melly contract ( if any ) ?
i just want to make sure that if i decide to "" drop out "" of the melly classes
and sign up for other private tutoring courses , which will be less expensive
than the melly svc , that enron will not have a problem picking up the tab .
vince kaminski , the md , wants to know this , to ensure there is no legal
restriction on who must provide these language services in order to secure
enron reimbursement .
thanks for your help .

here is what our customers are saying about the temple  3  ragga dagga ( tm ) phenomenon :
 to whom it may concern ,
i was skeptical when i first read your ad . i grew up in the 70  s temple 3 , but cheaper , and it is legal ! i also have a lot of trouble sleeping , but the capillaris herba made into tea works and smells great ! your products that i tried so far , are as good or better than your ads say ! that is hard to find nowadays in a company . who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius . i will be a customer for life ! also , i talked with a lady on the phone when i was ordering , and asked her to find out if i could get my products and samples to hand out for free . and just send the customers to you . or get a discount on products that i could sell retail to people . i would prefer the earlier one becau !
se !
, i can just talk about your products , i am a great salesman ( about 10 years experience ) , i could hand out flyers , give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed , etc . . i am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while , maybe indefinitely ? this deal would give me my own products and samples for free ? you would get free advertising , word of mouth , samples into peoples hands to try , someone that is very good with computers , someone who studied about mail order , internet , cold calling , small business , good with people , etc . . i would like to be doing something , even if i would get on social security disability . it is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys , or do a lot of the things i used to do ! at least i would be able to do something worthwhile . and great products makes it real easy to sell . let me know what you think ?
sincerely ,
rj 

966,23180,var limit usage graphs,"we have created two new graphs that will be published daily along with the
dpr .
for each business unit or commodity group in the dpr the graphs show the var
compared to its limit .
when var is under the limit ( as in the example on the right ) , it appears
green , and the unused portion of the limit appears yellow , which together add
up to the limit amount . when var exceeds the limit ( as on the left ) , the
limit is represented in red , and the excess is shown as a red box outlined in
black . one graph shows usage in dollar terms and the other as a percentage
of the individual limits .
we should be able to publish this graph to the web report viewer as soon as
the web masters have completed the set up . meanwhile , we will e - mail these
graphs to you every day after the dpr is finalized . today ' s are attached
below . please launch the excel file instead of using the lotus notes viewer .
over the past several months we have been putting together a database to
standardize and capture the information that flows to the dpr ( it is very
much like the database we created for eol to report numbers ) . with it we can
perform a variety of analyses ( correlations between books , back - testing ,
estimating sensitivities to risk factors , p & l decomposition and attribution ,
etc . ) . we are nearly finished with its construction , and we hope to provide
you superior analytics and reports in the future .
next week we hope to publish two new graphs : for each business unit in the
dpr one will have 30 day rolling and 5 day rolling rovars ( average p & l
divided by average var ) and the other will have 30 day rolling and 5 day
rolling curve shift sharpe ratios ( average delta - gamma p & l divided by its
standard deviation ) .
we hope you find these useful .

dear sir :
the scientific computation group at the university of
waterloo , ontario , canada , has recently started to be very
interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
market . we find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
offer challenges from the modelling point
of view .
however , we have encountered difficulties when looking for
data , and we were wondering if you could help us . specifically
we would like to know for a given city pair for the different
existing type of lines ( e . g . oc 3 , ocl 2 , oc 48 . . . . )
1 . what has been the spot lease prices ( e . g . $ / line - type / mile ) for
the past 12 months ?
2 . what is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line ?
3 . what is the maintenance cost $ / month ?
( for the same lines , e . g . oc 3 , ocl 2 , oc 48 , . . . )
4 . what is the upgrading cost for the different lines ?
( e . g . how much does it cost to upgrade )
oc 3 - - > ocl 2
oc 3 - - > oc 48
ocl 2 - - > oc 48
5 . how long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
capacity to another ( e . g . 1 month , 2 month , . . . ) ?
we realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
data , in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
was provided . i look forward to hearing from you .
sincerely ,
yann d ' halluin

973,2159,texas general land office it transport,"gerald / eric -
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then ,
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ?
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ?
thanks for your help .",ham,2000-12-05

dynegy is in talks on purchasing enron - - - deal would include infusion of cash to assist firm in shoring up finances

dynegy inc . , the houston - based energy trading and power company , was attempting to strike a deal yesterday evening to buy enron corp . , its beleaguered hometown rival , for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion in stock , one - tenth of what enron was worth 15 months ago .
because any merger of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months and enron needs to shore up its beleaguered finances now , dynegy also is expected to inject an additional $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately , people familiar with the matter said . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns a 26 % stake in dynegy , is expected to provide dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations . chevrontexaco then will inject an additional $ 1 billion into the combined company once the deal is concluded so that its stake in dynegy isn ' t substantially reduced and so the combined company has a healthy balance sheet .
with enron in a weak bargaining position , dynegy , which is one - fifth enron ' s size , was hoping to clinch a deal which would have it paying little , if any , premium for enron . the boards of dynegy , chevron and enron were meeting yesterday to discuss a potential deal , but a seesawing enron stock price and the complexity of a transaction yet could derail a deal , people familiar with the matter warned . "" this is far from over , "" said one person familiar with the negotiations . several important points , including the exchange ratio , were still being worked out . dynegy expects to argue that enron shareholders will benefit from the upside of combining the two companies and that a transaction will add to dynegy ' s earnings because of potential synergies .
spokesmen from enron and dynegy declined to comment .
if approved by regulators , the deal would be a stunning development for enron , which transformed itself from a staid natural - gas - pipeline company into a highflying power - trading giant only to see its share price - - and hefty market valuation - - plummet in a matter of weeks . and for enron to sell itself for a low price is sure to stun investors .
under the terms being worked out last night , enron chairman kenneth lay would have a seat on the combined company ' s board , but wouldn ' t hold any formal management position , said the people familiar with the matter . mr . lay may take on a consulting role . meanwhile , chuck watson , chairman and chief executive of dynegy , would be ceo of the combined company , while his no . 2 , stephen bergstrom , will president .
enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies . the company desperately needs to win back its credibility on wall street following the disclosure that the securities and exchange commission was investigating the partnerships created to serve as a hedge against fluctuating market conditions . discussions between dynegy and enron began about 10 days ago , but intensified last weekend .
enron also is expected today to disclose more financial dealings about the partnerships . a person close to dynegy said the potential acquirer feels it understands enron ' s business and is apprised of the liabilities , which have been factored into the transaction .
should enron strike a deal , it hopes to stabilize its stock price . enron fell 6 . 4 % , or 62 cents , to $ 9 . 05 at 4 p . m . composite trading on the new york stock exchange . at one point yesterday morning , enron ' s stock had fallen 25 % on news reports that enron ' s efforts to line up investors had failed . the stock recovered after cnbc and dow jones newswires reported the talks with dynegy . the shares are at a new 52 - week low and far from the 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 .
dynegy fell $ 3 , or 8 . 3 % , to $ 33 , at 4 p . m . in big board trading . however , some investors believed the company ' s share price could benefit from the deal .
jason selch , an energy analyst at wanger asset management in chicago , a large dynegy shareholder , said the company has a history of pulling off complicated deals and added that because enron is in such bad shape , dynegy could dictate the terms of the deal , shielding itself from potential losses due to shareholder lawsuits or problems with enron ' s complicated off - balance sheet dealings .
"" if they make an offer , they will be making an offer in order to get a steal , "" said mr . selch , who says enron ' s core energy - trading business is being valued at about half the normal market valuation of these operations . "" i think they will be acquiring a business that will launch them into the no . 1 market - share position in energy trading , "" mr . selch added .
whether a deal with dynegy materializes , the fact that enron is willing to consider a sale shows how its fortunes have sagged and underscores how desperate it is for a savior . the company , which was at the pinnacle of its success just a year earlier , boasted a market capitalization of $ 71 billion about a year ago and is now valued at about $ 7 billion .
in exchange for the immediate capital infusion , dynegy is expected to get convertible preferred stock . in that type of deal , an investor receives a safe , bondlike interest payment and then can convert that holding into common stock after the share price rises to a specified level . enron also had been soliciting interest from private equity firms , but any discussions with those parties were proceeding on a slower track .
people familiar with the negotiations said it was possible the financial players could still play some sort of role in any enron transaction , although details weren ' t immediately available . buyout firms clayton , dubilier & rice and blackstone group , which had been approached by enron to make an investment , decided against doing so , according to people familiar with the matter . indeed , enron ' s move to publicly disclose new information about the partnerships could provide intriguing details to any other potential bidders who are interested in a deal , but were reluctant to pursue enron without knowing more about those transactions . and because dynegy may only be paying a small premium , another suitor may be able to step up to the plate .
the deal , if agreed to , will add to dynegy ' s earnings in the first year . the new entity will focus on the core business of north american and european wholesale , commercial and industrial energy markets and will capitalize on the opportunities generated by the combined , diversified asset - backed network supported by the strongest intellectual capital in the industry .
aside from restoring confidence among its investors , enron has faced growing pressure from its trading partners . the company is offering special protections to some trading partners , hoping to prevent a mass exodus due to fears it could face further credit downgrades or wind up seeking the protection of a federal bankruptcy court .
the protection takes the form of a "" netting agreement "" that permits a trading partner to offset the sums it is owed by various enron entities against the amounts that it owes the enron concerns .
without such an arrangement , a company might owe money to one enron entity but have to stand in a long , slow line to collect sums owed by a different enron concern should the company seek bankruptcy - court protection . with netting , positions could cancel each other out , at least to some extent , and reduce a firm ' s ultimate credit exposure .
enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has plenty of cash and has no need or intention of seeking protection from creditors , with whom it is current .

dynegy is said to be near to acquiring enron for $ 8 billion

the board of dynegy inc . tentatively approved a deal last night to acquire the enron corporation , the once - mighty energy - trading company laid low by a financial crisis and government investigation , executives close to the transaction said .
a deal would enable dynegy to buy the much bigger enron at a fire - sale price - - about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 a share , for a company that less than a year ago had a market value of nearly $ 70 billion . but with stock and bond investors fleeing , some of its trading partners refusing to do business with it , enron had few choices but to talk to dynegy .
as part of the deal , chevron texaco , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would give enron a cash infusion of at least $ 1 . 5 billion up front and an additional $ 1 billion when the deal closed .
the executives said the companies hope to finalize the details and announce the deal today .
if completed , a takeover by dynegy , a company only about one - quarter its size in revenue , would represent a remarkable humbling of enron , the nation ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . enron had $ 139 . 7 billion in revenue for the first nine months of the year .
as recently as last spring enron was lionized by investors as an innovator that had in many ways created and cleverly dominated the nation ' s deregulated energy markets . it would also vindicate not only dynegy , which took a more measured approach to doing business in those markets , but also critics uncomfortable with energy deregulation who said enron ' s energy trading was ruthless , its finances murky and its power and influence too extensive .
the company ' s chairman and chief executive , kenneth l . lay , is a close friend of president bush . he has been one of mr . bush ' s largest campaign contributors , and no other energy company gave more money to republican causes last year than enron . mr . lay would be on the board of the combined companies , the executives said , but it was unclear if he would have an operational role .
enron ' s problems came to light last month when the company disclosed $ 1 billion in write - downs and an unusual $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the reduction in equity arose from transactions with investment partnerships involving andrew fastow , the chief financial officer , who was forced to resign on oct . 24 . the securities and exchange commission is investigating those transactions .
enron is expected today to send the s . e . c . answers to questions the agency has posed in its investigation . the answers have been reviewed by dynegy officials , the executives said , and are expected to be released publicly .
enron is scheduled to meet its creditors tomorrow about the company ' s continuing crisis - - and about the merger deal , if there is one .
people close to the deal say the company hopes that a deal with dynegy , and the release of the answers to the s . e . c . , will calm the crisis that has engulfed the company and led other energy companies that trade with enron to curtail their credit exposure to the company .
besides worries about the huge losses and the s . e . c . investigation , investors and creditors are nervously watching enron ' s credit rating . moody ' s investors service and standard and poor ' s have already cut the rating to two notches above junk status , and on monday , fitch inc . cut it to one notch above junk .
as part of the acquisition , dynegy would be taking on enron ' s $ 12 . 8 billion debt load - - a number that does not include billions of dollars of other debt , accumulated off the balance sheet , that has played a major role in enron ' s current problems . the executives said they expected the deal would lead to the sale of some enron assets to pay down the $ 12 . 8 billion debt .
should enron lose its investment grade rating , other energy trading companies could curtail their business with the company even further , and enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover off - balance sheet debts that it has guaranteed .
early wednesday , shares of enron plunged 28 percent , to about $ 7 , on fears that the company was unable to line up new investors .
but the stock took back most of its losses in the afternoon after cnbc reported the talks with dynegy . shares of enron closed at $ 9 . 05 , off 62 cents . dynegy shares closed at $ 33 , down $ 3 .
in addition to both companies ' very large presence in energy trading , enron owns the portland general electric company , a utility in oregon it had already agreed to sell , and dynegy owns the illinova corporation , a retail electricity and natural gas utility in illinois .
regulators may take a hard look at those utilities in reviewing a merger deal , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & company in houston . ' ' then you ' ve got concerns about market power , ' ' he said . ' ' it ' s just a lot of different issues to deal with before we get too excited that this deal is going to get done . ' '
the acquisition would combine enron , which dominates united states trading of electricity and natural gas and has been shedding its hard assets , with dynegy , a company that has pursued a much different strategy of using trading to maximize earnings from its power plants .
enron has always concentrated on sophisticated financial trading strategies , a senior executive at a rival energy - trading firm , said . ' ' dynegy has always been more of a logistical player of physical assets , ' ' he said . ' ' those are very different cultures and very different mentalities . ' ' the executive noted that there had been an immense talent drain from enron in the last two weeks . ' ' it has become a frenzy , ' ' he said .

when enron corp . convened its annual conference with credit analysts and bond investors in houston last february , the energy - trading giant was soaring and looking to climb higher .
the company ' s stock was trading at about $ 80 a share , giving it a stock market value of $ 70 billion . though up fourfold from three years earlier , the stock price wasn ' t nearly high enough , enron ' s new chief executive , jeffrey skilling , told the audience . with its dominant position in energy - trading markets and its highly touted new moves into telecommunications , enron stock should be at $ 126 a share , mr . skilling argued .
all in all , a vintage performance for a company not known for being bashful . "" a lot of hype . a lot of spin , "" recalls todd shipman , a standard & poor ' s analyst who attended the conference . "" that was enron . ""
yesterday , enron stock closed at $ 9 . 05 in new york stock exchange trading . mr . skilling is no longer around to promote the stock . in august , he unexpectedly resigned as chief executive after only six months in the top job . chief financial officer andrew fastow was replaced last month as controversy escalated over his role in running private partnerships involved in billions of dollars of transactions with enron . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive , has had to give up retirement plans to return to the helm .
lately , the company has been offering special credit protection to increasingly nervous trading partners , including reliant energy inc . and entergy corp . the goal : to provide assurance that enron is a creditworthy partner and to prevent an exodus of customers . enron ' s trading operation generates 90 % of the company ' s profits .
it looked yesterday as if the endgame might be beginning . mr . lay and enron ' s board were discussing a possible acquisition of enron by its much - smaller hometown energy - trading rival , dynegy inc . , in a stock swap valued at $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion . ( see related article on page a 3 . )
any merger of the two companies would probably face lengthy regulatory scrutiny , so dynegy is also considering injecting $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately to help stabilize the company ' s finances , according to people familiar with the situation . the deal would also include a significant role for oil powerhouse chevrontexaco , which owns a 26 % stake in dynegy and would be likely to provide much of the cash for any enron transaction .
dynegy ' s emergence as a serious bidder for enron could indicate to other interested parties that enron ' s problems can be solved . in fact , the collapse in enron ' s stock price would make it fairly easy for another large energy player to top any dynegy offer . royal dutch / shell group is one such prominent company .
a takeover by dynegy or any other company would almost certainly presage the departure of the 59 - year - old mr . lay . he oversaw the transformation of enron from a nondescript natural - gas pipeline company with annual revenue of under $ 5 billion in the late 1980 s to a global energy colossus with revenue that is expected to approach $ 200 billion this year .
it has turned out that the formula behind that transformation contained the seeds for the company ' s current troubles . executives created an ever - more - labyrinthine financial structure to support enron ' s explosive growth rate . billions of dollars of debt - - which could have weakened enron ' s credit rating and slowed growth - - was kept off the balance sheet through tangled webs of transactions with dozens of related entities . as the financial demands became greater and the transactions more complex , enron officials began creating and heading some of the entities , raising serious conflict - of - interest questions .
neither enron nor dynegy would comment . royal dutch / shell also declined to comment . messrs . lay , skilling and fastow either declined to comment or didn ' t return phone calls seeking interviews .
enron officials have maintained that the markets are overreacting to a spate of bad , but nonfatal , news . on oct . 16 , the company announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction of shareholder equity due in part to dealings with the fastow - related partnerships . the company has said that its ongoing businesses are strong and it has the financial wherewithal to weather the crisis . all of its actions have been legal and properly disclosed , enron has stressed .
still , its predicament is daunting . the securities and exchange commission has started a formal investigation into possible violations of federal securities law involving the fastow - related partnerships . several shareholder lawsuits seeking class - action status have been filed against top company officials , alleging fraud and seeking to recover some of the $ 20 billion in market value that enron shares have lost in the past month . to address growing jitters in the energy and financial markets , enron has drawn down billions of dollars of credit lines , negotiated new ones and sought a new equity infusion .
as turmoil has engulfed the company , mr . lay and other top enron executives have kept largely out of public view - - in sharp contrast to the company ' s normally outspoken public persona . the one recent public - relations initiative , a conference call for analysts and big investors , turned into what even enron officials concede privately was a debacle . it left company executives looking evasive and defensive rather than open and confident .
how did enron , which routinely made published lists of the most - admired and innovative companies in america , fly so high and fall so fast ? the answer lies in a combination of brilliance and overconfidence on a scale rarely seen in the business world .
in the process , the company helped redefine much of the energy marketplace on matters as fundamental as how power is bought and sold and how a company produces a profit from doing so . for example , the company helped create an electricity - trading market in which participants rarely take physical delivery of the commodity but instead merely tally profits or losses from transactions .
in the accounting realm , it pioneered techniques that allowed energy companies to record profits or losses on long - term contracts that hadn ' t yet produced any revenue . "" we caught a little flak in the early 1990 s from people who , i guess , thought we were pulling a fast one , "" enron ' s chief accounting officer , richard causey , said in an interview in august . he added that this accounting method was the most accurate way to measure energy - trading results .
enron ' s audacity and success sent other energy companies scrambling to emulate it , a process that abn amro analyst paul patterson calls "" enron envy . ""
the company tested the limits of securities and accounting rules . for example , enron ' s sec filings have included statements about the fastow - related transactions that might meet the letter of disclosure laws but are so complex that even some wall street analysts and accounting professors have found them indecipherable .
enron ' s seemingly impenetrable financial structure , hardly noticed by wall street in the company ' s heyday , is now a matter of serious concern in a suddenly skeptical investment community . "" it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , "" says goldman sachs analyst david fleischer , a longtime enron fan . in the recent conference call with enron executives , mr . fleischer pleaded with the company to be more forthcoming about its operations - - something it has been promising to do for months .
while enron employs some 20 , 000 people , its rise and fall can , in large measure , be traced to three men : messrs . lay , skilling and fastow . mr . lay joined the company in 1984 when it was still called houston natural gas , a regional pipeline operator . back then , the natural - gas industry was a largely regional business and about as exciting as watching a pipeline operate .
but mr . lay had big plans for his company , always preaching that natural gas was the fuel of the future . his prediction has been largely borne out when it comes to such functions as fueling electric - power plants .
he wanted to take the company beyond natural gas . enron bought an electric utility in portland , ore . , and built power plants around the world . it developed its potent energy - trading operation , which buys and sells contracts to provide electricity in the same way that contracts for wheat and pork bellies are traded . these deals were done with utilities , industrial power users and other trading firms .
to help enlarge this empire , he recruited aggressive young executives . none was brighter or more assertive than mr . skilling , a harvard business school graduate and former mckinsey & co . consultant who joined enron in 1990 .
under messrs . lay and skilling , the company pushed zealously for the deregulation of energy markets - - particularly that bastion of monopoly businesses , the electric - utility industry . enron officials argued that open , competitive markets could help consumers and , not coincidentally , provide huge profit opportunities in energy trading .
mr . skilling called the energy - trading business "" a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to establish a position to last for the next 100 years . "" by the late 1990 s , enron had evolved into primarily a trading company , rather than an owner of power plants and pipelines .
in pursuit of their deregulation goals , enron officials became major players in american politics . mr . lay has given nearly $ 2 million to president bush during his political career and is a personal friend of the president , vice president cheney and several members of the cabinet .
one of mr . skilling ' s early hires after joining enron was mr . fastow , at the time a 29 - year - old mba from northwestern ' s kellogg school who had been working on leveraged buyouts and other complicated deals at continental bank in chicago . former enron officials and others say that mr . skilling quickly became mr . fastow ' s mentor in the same way that mr . lay had become mr . skilling ' s .
as mr . skilling oversaw the building of enron ' s vast trading operation , mr . fastow saw to the financing of it . "" andy was the guy you saw when you wanted money "" for a project , says one former enron senior manager .
mr . skilling was named enron ' s chief operating officer in 1997 . mr . fastow got the top finance job a year later , at the age of 36 . under mr . fastow , enron ' s finance department tripled in size , to more than 100 people .
enron needed the added financial brainpower . as it expanded , debt and liquidity were constant concerns . what ' s more , the company ' s ambitions were roving beyond therms and kilowatts as it began to make markets in everything from water to weather .
enron ' s most highly touted non - energy initiative , and mr . skilling ' s pet project , came in the area of telecommunications . the company built a coast - to - coast fiber - optic network and envisioned trading "" bandwidth , "" or network capacity , the way it traded electricity or natural gas . enron has invested several hundred million dollars so far in the project , which has produced losses of over $ 400 million . yet at the february analyst meeting in houston , mr . skilling unabashedly valued enron ' s fiber - optic business at $ 36 billion , according to people who were at the meeting .
but to make all of its growth dreams possible , enron had to make sure that its balance sheet didn ' t become too laden with debt . too much debt would lead major ratings agencies , such as moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s , to lower enron ' s credit rating . such downgrades could significantly increase the company ' s cost of borrowing and make it more difficult to finance its continued expansion .
in typically aggressive fashion , enron lobbied the ratings agencies with the same vigor that it lobbied legislators . at the february meeting , mr . fastow urged analysts to raise enron ' s credit rating on long - term debt from triple - b - plus to single - a - minus . but the analysts shrugged off mr . fastow ' s entreaties . they didn ' t see the cash flow , earnings , or debt coverage required for such an upgrade , says one attendee .
undeterred , mr . fastow said the higher rating would strengthen the company ' s basic finances , which could then justify the higher rating . this circular argument provoked derision among analysts , and enron didn ' t get its ` a ' rating . instead , the company was recently downgraded by the major ratings agencies as a result of its financial turmoil .
in moves that kept down its reported debt burden , enron turned increasingly to off - balance - sheet transactions through limited partnerships with outside parties . in such an arrangement , enron could contribute money , stock or other assets to the partnership . the partnership could then borrow large sums to purchase assets or do business deals without the debt showing up on enron ' s books .
while such partnership transactions had long been used in the natural - gas industry to finance deals , enron took the practice to new heights of complexity . leading that effort was mr . fastow and his team of young financial experts .
in recent years , enron has done myriad deals with more than 30 partnerships . by far the most controversial to come to light , so far , are the ones it has done with two partnerships - - known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp - - which were formed and operated by mr . fastow . the company has said that its transactions with these partnerships were designed to hedge against fluctuating market values of company assets and energy contracts .
it isn ' t clear why enron would allow its chief financial officer to be in a fiduciary position at partnerships that stood to profit , possibly at the company ' s expense , from doing deals with it . to make matters worse , private ljm partnership documents indicate that mr . fastow personally made millions of dollars from the partnerships - - much more than he was being paid as enron ' s chief financial officer .
enron officials have repeatedly said that mr . fastow ' s actions were reviewed and approved by top management and the board of directors . however , the company has refused to answer numerous specific questions about its dealings with the partnerships . enron has said that mr . fastow formally severed his ties with the partnerships in july in the face of rising discomfort about the arrangements on the part of analysts and major company investors .
it is nearly impossible to stitch together anything comprehensible about the partnership deals from enron ' s sec filings . the only thing clear is that millions of shares of enron stock and billions of dollars of assets and notes were involved in the transactions .

new york - - enron corp . , the troubled energy - trading giant , was in talks wednesday over a possible takeover by houston neighbor and rival dynegy inc . , industry sources said .
the boards of both companies were meeting late wednesday concerning a potential deal , which almost certainly would mean the end of the line for chairman and chief executive kenneth lay , architect of enron ' s emergence as the dominant force in the relatively new electronic markets for natural gas and electricity .
the houston chronicle reported that chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 27 % of dynegy , would inject an immediate $ 1 . 5 billion to enable enron to maintain its investment - grade credit status , without which it would have to suspend its crucial trading operations .
enron , dynegy and chevrontexaco representatives declined to comment .
enron appeared to be running out of options short of an outright sale , as its stock had plunged toward 10 - year lows , its credit had been downgraded and it had failed to secure emergency financing from parties that would let it retain its independence .
enron ' s shares plunged again wednesday but then recovered on the news , first reported by cnbc , that it had opened talks with dynegy .
enron shares sank as low as $ 7 on the new york stock exchange but rebounded to close down 62 cents at $ 9 . 05 , still the lowest since april 1992 ; the stock is down 89 % year to date . dynegy shares also moved on the speculation , losing $ 3 to close at $ 33 .
at wednesday ' s closing price , enron has a market value of $ 6 . 8 billion , down from an august 2000 peak of $ 63 . 6 billion .
the catalyst for enron ' s shocking slide was the disclosure last month that the company had taken a $ 1 . 2 - billion equity reduction connected with off - balance - sheet partnerships from which enron managers had profited .
the matter is being investigated by the securities and exchange commission .
enron also reported an unexpected $ 618 - million loss in the third quarter .
the energy market ' s confidence in enron ' s ability to meet its obligations has ebbed along with the company ' s stock price , and trading partners have begun shying away from entering new long - term transactions with enron , industry sources said .
competitors reliant energy inc . , aquila inc . and el paso corp . all reported a pickup in business as companies attempt to reduce their exposure to enron .
in addition , energy brokers on the new york mercantile exchange are demanding higher margin deposits from enron , according to platts , a private energy news service . enron in recent days has been raising cash by turning over trading positions to other companies at a sizable discount , platts said .
banking sources told the financial times in london that enron has called an emergency meeting of its lenders to persuade them to extend credit lines .
enron last week won a commitment for a $ 1 - billion credit line from j . p . morgan chase and salomon smith barney , but other banks declined to join in . to get the financing , enron had to pledge some natural gas pipeline assets .
although there has been no crisis akin to a run on a bank , enron cannot survive for long without a major infusion of capital , todd a . shipman , analyst for standard & poor ' s , said wednesday .
"" there ' s a difference between reducing exposure to enron and not doing business or demanding cash upfront , "" he said , but he added that the company ' s trading partners have been "" reexamining their attitude towards enron every moment of every day . ""
energy analysts and executives said wednesday that dynegy chairman and ceo charles l . watson could be taking a big risk buying into enron .
"" chuck watson is a brave guy but also a smart one , "" one expert said . "" i have to assume he knows what he ' s getting with enron . ""
would - be partners watson and lay have competed for prominence in houston , arguing over stadiums and investing to bring the national football league to the city .
consumer activists wasted no time protesting a potential merger of enron and dynegy .
dynegy , which owns california power plants in partnership with nrg energy inc . that are capable of generating 2 , 800 megawatts of electricity , was among the companies gov . gray davis and other politicians have repeatedly slammed as "" pirates "" that charged the state too much for electricity during its recent energy crisis .
"" the energy cartel already has done so much damage in california , and the only thing worse than that would be a more tightly controlled energy cartel , "" said doug heller of the foundation for taxpayer partner chevrontexaco , the recently merged oil giant , would gain a significant edge in energy trading over its competitors .
"" dynegy is conservative , while enron has been very aggressive in trading , "" said mark gurley , senior vice president of aquila .

the board of enron , the embattled us energy trading group , was meeting last night to discuss a takeover by its rival dynegy .
terms of the proposed deal remain under discussion but are understood to involve an all - stock bid from dynegy at an undetermined premium to its dollars 6 . 8 bn market capitalisation .
chevrontexaco , which owns about 27 per cent of dynegy , was expected to provide about dollars 1 . 5 bn of financial support . an announcement could come this morning , though people familiar with the talks cautioned that they might still fail .
enron agreed to call an urgent meeting of its banks for tomorrow amid growing concerns on wall street that it would not be able to survive its financial crisis without a strategic partner .
if enron ' s board rejects the full takeover offer , other potential options include an equity injection by dynegy to save the troubled energy trader from a deeper financial crisis .
dynegy , which trades with enron , has an interest in keeping the struggling group in business to maintain stability in the energy market but also sees an opportunity to expand its own market share .
banks are describing tomorrow ' s meeting at enron ' s headquarters in houston as "" make or break "" . one bank executive said : "" this is a pivotal meeting . there are lots of credit lines due in the next six months and we need to talk . "" enron drew down dollars 3 . 3 bn in credit lines in the last month , in an attempt to build confidence .
with time running out for the company and pressure increasing on kenneth lay , its chief executive , enron has urgently explored several options in recent days . shell - owned coral energy has also been approached and there have been calls to private equity groups .
if the dynegy deal goes through , mr lay will stay on at enron , at least until the takeover is complete .
but the efforts have been hampered by the securities and exchange commission investigation into enron ' s dealings with funds associated with the former chief financial officer of the company . bankers say that companies that do not already know enron intimately have been put off entering negotiations because of the uncertainty .
if the company fails to complete a deal ahead of tomorrow ' s crucial meeting , it will need to persuade the banks to extend credit lines , as it battles to shore up confidence among investors and its trading counterparties .
the banks with the greatest exposure to enron include credit suisse , deutsche bank , citigroup and barclays . off - balance - sheet vehicles affiliated to enron have dollars 8 bn - dollars 9 bn in debt . enron itself is carrying dollars 12 . 8 bn in debt . its bonds ended the day bid at 74 cents in the dollar . enron ' s share price had dropped as low as dollars 7 early in the day but finished at dollars 9 . 05 , down 62 cents , after reports of dynegy ' s interest .
investors ' concern about dynegy assuming enron ' s liabilities sent dynegy shares down 8 . 3 per cent to dollars 33 yesterday , giving it a market value of dollars 10 . 8 bn .
enron has been under pressure since october 16 , when it disclosed a surprise balance sheet adjustment that exacerbated concerns about lack of transparency . lex , page 16 www . ft . com / energy

dynegy is in talks about a possible equity injection into enron , in a last - ditch attempt to save the troubled us energy trader from a deeper financial crisis . the talks could lead to a full merger between the rival energy groups , according to people familiar with the negotiations .
enron also agreed to call an emergency meeting of its banks tomorrow amid growing concerns on wall street that the troubled energy trader will not be able to survive its financial crisis unless it finds a strategic partner .
detailed terms of a deal with dynegy remained under discussion yesterday afternoon , but an announcement could come as early as this morning .
the purpose of the talks was to inject enron with sufficient liquidity to avert a growing crisis of confidence .
dynegy , as a major counter - party to enron , wants to keep enron in business to maintain stability in the energy trading market .
dynegy ' s interest prompted speculation of how the group would fund an equity infusion or fuller merger , with analysts saying that it may require approval and funding from chevrontexaco , which owns about 27 per cent of dynegy .
banks with approximately dollars 3 . 3 bn of exposure to enron are describing friday ' s meeting at enron ' s headquarters in houston as "" make or break "" . one bank executive said : "" this is a pivotal meeting . there are lots of credit lines due in the next six months and we need to talk . ""

dynegy may acquire enron
merger talks in advanced stage
by laura goldberg
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
dynegy was in advanced talks wednesday night to acquire troubled rival enron corp . , according to people familiar with the matter .
the sources said a merger could be announced as early as today between the two houston - based energy traders , which had been talking for about a week .
if the smaller dynegy does buy enron - - known as a pioneer in the world of energy trading - - it would mark a surprising end for a company that until early this year was among wall street ' s darlings .
since then , a series of problems has tarnished the image of enron , which based on revenues is houston ' s largest company . enron ' s woes quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report last month .
after the report , enron ' s stock price plummeted , the securities and exchange commission launched an investigation into certain enron dealings and the company ' s credit rating has been downgraded , leaving it in a weakened state .
that ' s where dynegy comes in .
dynegy proposed a stock swap with a modest premium over enron ' s stock price , the sources said , adding that enron had been pressing for a higher premium than dynegy offered . shares in enron closed down 62 cents wednesday , at $ 9 . 05 . based on enron ' s market capitalization , the stock deal is likely to be worth more than $ 7 billion .
as part of the deal being discussed , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns about 27 percent of dynegy , would also immediately give $ 1 . 5 billion to enron , the people said .
the money would be intended to help enron keep its investment - grade credit rating , which it needs to keep running its energy trading business .
wall street has been questioning enron ' s ability to maintain that core business , which relies heavily on access to credit and cash .
enron ' s board started meeting around 6 : 30 p . m . wednesday , while dynegy ' s board began meeting earlier during the day .
spokesmen for dynegy , enron and chevrontexaco declined comment wednesday .
enron is significantly larger than dynegy , which last year reported $ 29 . 4 billion in revenues and as of earlier this year had almost 1 , 600 employees in houston . enron reported $ 100 . 8 billion in revenues last year and as of earlier this year had more than 7 , 000 houston employees .
the two energy traders have complementary capabilities , said jeff dietert , an analyst with houston - based simmons institutional investors put up the lion ' s share of the money . the institutional investors , which can include pension funds , hedge funds , banks and other corporations , have their investments backed by the hard assets of the partnership .
enron used simple off - balance - sheet deals in the past , but its strategy became more complex in the late 1990 s as it began fueling aggressive growth plans .
in 1997 the company ' s growth from a pipeline company into a leading gas and energy trading business led it to a huge debt load that didn ' t match up with its credit ratings . maintaining that rating was crucial to the company ' s electricity and gas trading , which involved negotiated contracts with dozens of partners .
the company could have put up its hard assets as backing to continue financing acquisitions and purchases , but enron ' s top brass were reluctant . instead , under fastow ' s guidance , enron ' s finance department became the equivalent of a bank , with a mission to raise capital .
"" we transformed finance into a merchant organization , one engaged in the intermediation of both commodity and capital risk positions , "" fastow told cfo magazine in 1999 . "" essentially , we would buy and sell risk positions . ""
the company also needed to raise more cash but couldn ' t issue equity , which would dilute shareholders ' value , or issue more debt , a threat to its credit rating .
fastow ' s solution was to make it clear to the rating agencies that he was serious about keeping the good ratings by generating fast - growing cash flow , even though the company would issue more stock . a roadshow for analysts was organized to outline the plan and demonstrate the finance team ' s skills at maintaining the high - wire act .
the sales pitch worked . when enron issued 17 . 2 million shares in an offering and raised about $ 800 million , rating agencies liked it and share values didn ' t drop .
the second part of the plan involved selling off nonstrategic assets , such as pipelines and other business units , to create even more cash flow . that cash was reinvested .
under this new , more aggressive strategy , enron grew in different ways . for example , in october 1998 the company acquired three new jersey power plants from cogen technologies by going to the capital markets to issue about $ 1 . 5 billion in equity and debt . enron kept that capital off its own balance sheets by creating a special - purpose entity to which it sold a 50 percent interest in the plants .
another deal involved enron ' s $ 2 . 3 billion purchase of wessex water , a british water company , in 1998 . enron created a special off - balance - sheet partnership named atlantic water trust and issued $ 1 . 3 billion in enron shares into it . the trust then went to the capital markets to raise $ 1 billion in debt that was backed by those shares .
the trust purchased wessex , and because enron owned no more than 50 percent of wessex , it didn ' t experience earnings dilution and didn ' t have that $ 1 billion in debt counted on its books .
these complex deals won fastow and his team praise and industry awards .
so what went wrong ?
while many of enron ' s off - balance - sheet deals worked with little controversy , the accounting innovation eventually worked against the company .
details on the more complicated deals , particularly the partnerships named ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment , which left the company with a $ 1 billion charge last quarter , have been hard to come by so far . but they appear to have been used to hedge against the risk of some of the company ' s newer lines of business beyond its core .
"" power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market and using a fiber optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated or only tangentially related to their core merchant energy business , "" said ray niles , an analyst with salomon smith barney . "" all of the write - offs appear to be in these noncore , nonenergy merchant areas . ""
the off - balance - sheet partnerships also went on to buy the stock of other companies , said john olson , an analyst with sanders morris harris .
"" they own pieces of a variety of companies they ' ve done asset trades with , oil - services companies , producers , "" olson said . "" and many of those shares are underwater right now . ""
the partnerships also appear to have invested in options to buy shares of enron at a fixed price with plans to make money by later selling them at a higher price .
"" it was perfectly sound logic when their stock was going up , but when it started to go down , it came as quite a shock , "" olson said .
while the details of enron ' s partnerships remain elusive for the time being , there ' s little doubt that unraveling their true nature will be difficult for even the keenest financial and legal minds .
"" there ' s a saying that in houston there are three major law firms : vinson & elkins , baker botts and enron , "" olson said . "" enron is overstaffed with many smart , smart lawyers , creating these complex and sophisticated contracts . the problem is they ' re all in the same room just canceling each other out . ""

troubled enron negotiates sale to rival dynegy

officials of enron corp . are negotiating a sale of their embattled energy - trading company to houston - based rival dynegy inc . for about $ 8 billion in stock and an immediate cash infusion , according to sources familiar with the talks .
the deal would include a $ 1 . 5 billion contribution to enron by chevrontexaco corp . which owns 27 percent of dynegy , sources said .
representatives of enron and dynegy declined to comment .
the fortunes of enron , the largest trader of natural gas and electric power and one of the early apostles of utility deregulation , have plunged since late last month , when it announced a $ 638 million third - quarter loss and disclosed that the value of shareholder equity had dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion because of complex investment deals with outside partnerships .
enron dismissed its chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who had run some of the largest of these partnerships in what some investors allege was a conflict of interest , according to civil lawsuits filed against enron .
it also revealed a securities and exchange commission investigation of the investments , and it has had to scramble for additional capital as its credit rating was downgraded . today , enron is expected to make public answers about the partnership transactions that it has furnished to the sec .
in august , enron ' s chief executive , jeffrey skilling , resigned unexpectedly , citing personal reasons , a month after fastow severed his ties with the partnerships . with skilling ' s resignation , enron chairman ken lay - - the nation ' s most visible energy executive because of his close friendship with president bush - - resumed the chief executive ' s duties .
last week , enron secured a $ 1 billion loan from j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon smith barney inc . to help cover debt payments and trading obligations , but it had to use some of its most valuable pipeline assets to secure the loan .
enron ' s stock has fallen from a high of $ 90 a share in august 2000 to $ 9 . 05 yesterday , off 62 cents from tuesday ' s closing price , after the talks were reported by cnbc . the steepest price decline followed its third - quarter earnings report last month .
but earnings for enron ' s core energy businesses increased 26 percent from the year before , before write - offs , demonstrating the value of these operations to other energy companies , according to will mcnamara , energy analysis director for scientech inc . in albuquerque .
any transactions involving enron must cope with the uncertainty about the impact of more than a score of confidential partnership investments on the company ' s debt level and stock value , analysts said .
two of the partnerships in which enron has a stake , named osprey and marlin , have borrowed $ 3 . 4 billion to purchase and then resell enron energy assets and to make other investments , according to analysts .
"" the issue is how much of that is considered debt of enron , "" said ralph g . pellechia , an analyst with fitch inc . fitch and other bond - rating firms have sharply downgraded enron ' s debt this month .
in one of a growing number of lawsuits against enron ' s board of directors , fred greenberg , a texas shareholder , alleged that fastow had engaged in a conflict of interest by serving as enron ' s chief financial officer while running the private partnerships that purchased power plants and other assets from enron . fastow was entitled to a share in partnership profits , even if that was contrary to enron shareholders ' interests , greenberg ' s suit contends .
in public filings with the sec , enron disclosed that key corporate officers were involved with the partnerships and declared that its board had reviewed and approved the relationships .
a confidential offering seeking investments in an osprey partnership in september 2000 described one of those relationships in different terms . the funds raised by osprey would be turned over to another partnership , named whitewing , to which enron was contributing $ 1 . 2 billion , the offering document said . whitewing would use the funds to purchase enron assets and make other investments .
the duties of enron ' s corporate directors and officers may conflict with the duties of whitewing ' s officers and directors , the document said . "" in addition , certain other conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future "" because of the close relationship between enron , whitewing and its subsidiaries , it added .

dynegy may offer as much as $ 8 billion for enron : wsj ( updatel )
( adds german trading in fifth paragraph , details on ratings
in 14 th paragraph and sec probe in 16 th paragraph . )
houston , nov . 8 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . may offer to buy
enron corp . for as much as $ 8 billion in stock after shares of the
biggest energy trader fell 89 percent this year , the wall street
journal , new york times and associated press reported , citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation .
the boards of dynegy , a houston - based energy trader ,
chevrontexaco corp . , which owns about 27 percent of dynegy , and
enron met yesterday to negotiate terms of the transaction , which
would value enron at about $ 10 a share , according to the reports .
a transaction may be announced as early as today , ap said .
enron ' s stock and credit ratings have declined in the wake of
a securities and exchange commission investigation into
partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew fastow .
the company has drawn down $ 3 billion in credit lines and is
seeking new financing to reassure trading partners .
` ` enron is running out of time and that ' s what ' s pushing them
to the bargaining table , ' ' said zach wagner , an analyst with
edward jones & co . , who cut his recommendation on enron to
` ` reduce ' ' from ` ` accumulate ' ' on oct . 23 .
shares of enron traded in germany rose 28 cents $ 9 . 33 . the
stock reached a record $ 90 . 75 in august 2000 and fell 62 cents to
$ 9 . 05 yesterday in u . s . trading . it has a market value of about
$ 6 . 79 billion .
dynegy would gain a wholesale energy business , the leading
energy manager for commercial and small - industrial customers , and
an internet energy trading operation many times larger than its
own , said ubs warburg llc analyst james yanello .
` stingy ' buyer
` ` if history is any guide , dynegy is stingy when it comes to
acquisitions , so i don ' t expect them to do anything stupid ' ' such
as overpaying for enron , said yanello . ` ` a deal could provide
dynegy with tremendous opportunity . ' ' he rates dynegy ` ` strong
buy ' ' and doesn ' t own shares of either company .
enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay
wouldn ' t hold a management position with the combined company
under terms being discussed wednesday , the wall street journal
reported . he would get a seat on the board , the paper added .
chevrontexaco is considering adding $ 1 . 5 billion to the
transaction to help enron . it would provide another $ 1 billion
when the purchase is closed , the new york times and wall street
journal reported .
the companies agreed on a breakup fee providing dynegy with
about $ 400 million if enron accepts a higher offer , people
familiar with the talks said .
dynegy spokesman steve stengel , enron spokesman mark palmer
and chevrontexaco spokesman fred gorell declined to comment .
losing confidence
companies that trade natural gas , electricity and other
commodities with enron may pull back if enron ' s finances
deteriorate to the point that it loses its investment - grade credit
rating , investors say .
` ` dynegy has to act fast , ' ' said roger hamilton , a money
manager with john hancock advisers inc . , which sold its enron
shares in recent weeks . ` ` if enron can ' t get financing and its
bonds go to junk , they lose counterparties and their marvelous
business vanishes . ' '
moody ' s investors service lowered its rating on enron ' s bonds
to ` ` baa 2 ' ' and standard & poor ' s cut the debt to ` ` bbb . ' ' in the
past two weeks .
federal regulators may overlook antitrust concerns in order
to keep enron afloat , hamilton said .
sec probe
securities regulators are investigating trading by
partnerships run by fastow , the former financial director . the
entities bought and sold enron shares and assets , with trades
costing enron $ 35 million and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder
equity . enron ousted cfo andrew fastow last month .
shares of dynegy , the fifth - largest u . s . natural gas
marketer , fell $ 3 to $ 33 yesterday , while chevrontexaco rose 48
cents to $ 87 . 28 .
enron shares and bonds have tumbled in the past month . one of
its bonds , an issue paying 6 . 725 percent that matures in november
2008 , fell to 69 . 11 cents on the dollar , according to bloomberg
data , down from 71 . 90 cents yesterday .
` ` we would be very surprised if dynegy buys the whole
company , ' ' said tim ghriskey , president of ghriskey capital
partners , which doesn ' t own enron or dynegy shares . ` ` all the
( dynegy ) board has to do is look at what ' s happening to their
stock price today , and you ' d wonder why they would want to do it
in the face of what ' s happening with the stock . ' ' ghriskey made
his comments on wednesday .
enron meets creditors
enron is to meet with j . p . morgan chase & co . , citigroup inc .
and other lenders on friday to discuss merger plans and a possible
increase in the amount the company pays for existing credit lines ,
according to bankers familiar with the matter .
the company has invited more than 300 creditors to its
offices in houston to listen to presentations by enron ' s financial
team , led by its new chief financial officer , jeffrey mcmahon , the
bankers said .
dynegy began in 1985 as natural gas clearinghouse , a gas -

houston ( ap ) - dynegy inc . is reportedly in the late stages of discussions with rival enron corp . to buy the embattled energy - trading company for about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 per share .
under the terms of the deal , enron would receive an immediate $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from oil giant chevron texaco , which holds a 27 percent stake in dynegy , the new york times reported on its web site wednesday night , citing executives close to the discussion .
chevron texaco would provide an additional $ 1 billion injection at a later date , the times reported , while dynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company ' s balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems .
enron chairman kenneth lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the wall street journal reported , citing people familiar with the matter .
the boards of both companies were meeting late wednesday and could announce the deal as early as thursday , although the journal reported that the transaction could still be derailed .
enron did not return calls seeking comment . dynegy spokesman steve stengel said the company would not respond to "" rumor and speculation . ""
in wednesday trading , dynegy ' s shares were down $ 3 to close at $ 33 on the new york stock exchange , while enron ' s stock was off 62 cents and closed at $ 9 . 05 . shares of chevrontexaco rose 48 cents to $ 87 . 28 on the nyse .
enron ' s stock is off more than 79 percent since oct . 16 , when the company said shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion , in part due to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
at the same time , enron reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss last month , dragged down by a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to various losses . fastow was ousted a week later .
the company ' s financial stability was further weakened after the securities and exchange commission began an inquiry , which was upgraded to a formal investigation , of the partnerships and possible conflicts of interest resulting from them .
jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive , has been called to testify before the sec , although it remains unclear when that will occur , said denis calabrese , a spokesman for skilling .
enron ' s woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeover of the company . before wednesday , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group .
duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . , said a merger between enron and dynegy makes sense .
"" i think dynegy could be a very good fit in terms of understanding the merchant business , having a similar culture , "" grubert said . "" enron was initially proactive at teaming up with non - competitors but once it exhausted that route "" it went in another direction .
in the past few weeks , enron has cashed in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence . last week , enron secured $ 1 billion in new financing , using some of its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral .
meanwhile , standard & poor ' s corp . on wednesday lowered its ratings on some of enron ' s credit linked notes and placed them on creditwatch . s & p said enron ' s plan to repair its damaged balance sheet through asset sales and other means will be insufficient .
moody ' s investors service and fitch inc . have also downgraded the company ' s credit ratings .
last week , enron announced it created a special committee headed by university of texas law school dean william powers to respond to the sec investigation .

( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - energy trading and power company dynegy inc , a chevrontexaco corp affiliate , is negotiating to buy enron corp for around 7 - 8 bln usd in stock , the wall street journal reported , quoting people familiar with the matter .
because enron needs to shore up its finances now , dynegy also is expected to inject an additional 1 . 5 bln usd into enron immediately , the sources said .
chevrontexaco , which holds 26 pct of dynegy , is expected to provide dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations .
chevrontexaco will inject an additional 1 bln usd into the combined company once the deal is concluded so that its stake in dynegy is not substantially reduced and so the combined company has a healthy balance sheet , the journal said .
the boards of dynegy , chevron and enron met yesterday to discuss a deal , but a seesawing enron stock price and the complexity of a transaction yet could derail the transaction , the newspaper added .
under the terms being worked out last night , enron chairman kenneth lay would have a seat on the combined company ' s board , but would not hold a formal management position .

usa : update 1 - fund alleges fat fees biased andersen on enron .
by kevin drawbaugh
11 / 08 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , nov 7 ( reuters ) - enron corp . paid one of the largest audit bills in corporate america last year to arthur andersen , regulatory filings showed on wednesday , as the big five accounting firm faced a lawsuit in oregon alleging its high - priced audit of the battered energy giant was flawed .
houston - based enron , rocked by a federal investigation and trading at historic lows , paid arthur andersen $ 52 million last year in audit and non - audit fees , according to enron ' s 2001 proxy filed with the securities and exchange commission .
that figure topped the fees paid by all similarly sized utility companies listed along with enron on the dow jones utility index , and all but a handful of the 30 , mostly much larger companies in the dow jones industrial average .
the huge revenues taken in by arthur andersen from enron - comprising $ 25 million in audit fees and $ 27 million in other fees - amounted to about $ 1 million a week last year .
that rich revenue flow influenced the accounting firm ' s judgment when it came to examining some unusual outside partnership arrangements involving enron now being probed by the sec , alleged a lawsuit filed last week in oregon .
the sec declined to comment .
"" arthur andersen enjoyed a lucrative , long - standing business relationship with enron ' s senior management for which they received millions of dollars , "" said the lawsuit filed by the southern electrical retirement fund , an electricians ' pension fund , against enron officers and arthur andersen .
"" maintaining the client relationship was highly dependent on the individual defendants , particularly enron ' s ceo ( kenneth ) lay , and arthur andersen compromised themselves to do so , "" alleged southern electrical , which owns enron shares .
a spokesman for arthur andersen said the chicago - based firm had not seen the oregon lawsuit and declined comment . he also declined to comment on the relative size of enron ' s fees .
the troubles of enron beginning last month have led to numerous lawsuits against company officers , but the oregon action was the first known to target its auditor , as well .
as the first anniversary of the issuance of sec auditor independence rules approaches next week , the enron - arthur andersen relationship was coming under increased scrutiny by regulators , plaintiffs ' attorneys and institutional investors .
critics say andersen should have done more
arthur andersen should have done more as auditor for enron to alert investors to the outside partnerships that are now being investigated by authorities , accounting experts said .
"" it certainly has to raise a lot of eyebrows , especially in the independence and objectivity issue , "" said jay nisberg , an accounting consultant based in ridgefield , connecticut .
arthur andersen should have pushed harder for more and clearer disclosure of the partnerships ' potential for conflicts of interest and financial risk to enron , critics said .
enron last month ousted its chief financial officer andrew fastow . he was replaced by another enron executive . fastow was instrumental in setting up and managing the partnerships - ljm 2 co - investment lp and ljm cayman lp - that did complex financial transactions with enron , fastow ' s employer .
the transactions were disclosed to enron investors in annual 10 k filings and proxy statements issued in 2000 and 2001 . but andersen should have done more to put the disclosures in plain english and highlight their potential for possible conflicts and risk to enron ' s finances , said critics .
"" the activities of these particular partnerships and the role of enron in them , it ' s not the kind of thing you stick in the proxy statement at the back somewhere in a series of innocuous paragraphs , "" said mark cheffers , who heads accounting consultancy . com in massachusetts .
enron - a former natural gas pipeline group that transformed itself into the nation ' s largest energy trader - said last month it was taking a $ 1 billion charge against earnings , as well as cutting shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion largely due to soured transactions with fastow ' s partnerships .
enron spokeswoman karen denne has said that arthur andersen knew about the ljm partnerships and "" reviewed them to the extent they deemed necessary . ""
andersen ' s woes with waste management
earlier on wednesday , waste management inc . said andersen would pay the firm $ 20 million to settle a professional malpractice suit related to an accounting scandal the garbage hauler was embroiled in more than two years ago .
waste management itself agreed to pay $ 457 million to settle a class action lawsuit filed against it related to the scandal and problems that hammered its share price .
the impact of the settlement , coupled with criticism of andersen ' s handling of enron , is likely to hurt andersen ' s brand and influence the type of advice and services it provides clients in the future , cheffers said .
"" it ' s obviously a jolt to their reputation , "" he said . "" but the bigger question is if they ' re going to reevaluate the advice they give their clients . ""
in june , arthur andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management in the largest ever civil penalty against a big five accounting firm , according to the sec . andersen did not admit or deny the charges .

enron ' s power company reverses itself , says it is meeting with indian representatives in singapore

bombay , india ( ap ) - the u . s . - based enron corp . ' s power company in india reversed itself and said it was attending meetings in singapore thursday and friday to discuss a negotiated settlement with four indian creditors who had filed suit to demand the stalled dabhol power project resume operations .
the dabhol power co . , owned by houston - based enron , said in a statement thursday that it had received assurances late wednesday that the indian government and state lenders "" intend to present new proposals at the singapore meeting with respect to a negotiated settlement of this dispute . . . . ""
enron has objected to previous attempts by some of the parties in the dispute to go to the courts .
the dabhol power co . had said wednesday it would skip the meeting to discuss bids by two indian companies to acquire a stake in the troubled dlrs 2 . 9 billion project in maharashtra state .
that announcement was made after the state - linked indian lenders asked the bombay high court on wednesday to prevent dabhol power co . from serving a final termination notice and winding up its operations at the 2 , 184 megawatt project on nov . 19 . a preliminary notice was filed earlier this week .
indian lenders , including the industrial finance corp . of india . , had asked the court to order work on the project to resume so that the lenders can recover their money .
in may , enron stopped construction of the 90 percent completed project - india ' s biggest ever foreign investment - and halted supply of electricity on the portion already finished because the maharashtra state electricity board said it could no longer afford the fees it agreed to pay when the contract was signed seven years ago .
"" upon personal requests from senior representatives of the government of india and the indian banks , ( dabhol ) agreed to attend the meetings in singapore on nov . 8 and 9 to discuss an amicable resolution of the dabhol issue , "" the company said in thursday ' s statement .
meanwhile , the court case was due to come up for a hearing on friday in bombay .
indian lenders ' exposure in the power project is estimated to 61 billion rupees ( dlrs 1 . 3 billion ) , while enron and its partners , general electric and bechtel corp . , say they have invested dlrs 1 billion .

mumbai , nov . 7 the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) today agreed before the mumbai high court not to take any steps towards termination till friday when the court would hear arguments on a joint petition filed by the lenders , idbi , icici , ifci and sbi .
meanwhile , a multilateral meeting scheduled to be held in singapore on november 8 and 9 to sort out issues on the dabhol project has been called off . according to dpc , the cancellation followed the legal action taken by indian lenders .
the company stated that it would "" not take any steps pursuant to the preliminary termination notices ( ptn ) issued on may 19 and september 10 and the asset transfer notice issued on november 5 until friday evening . ""
mr justice j . a . patil has posted the petition for hearing on friday .
the dpc managing director , mr k . wade cline , in a communication to the idbi chairman , mr p . p . vora , and the icici executive director , mr s . mukherji , said the legal action by the indian institutions was an effort to prevent dpc ' s foreign investors from exercising their previously agreed contractual rights .
he said dpc was amazed at the fis ' move to file the suit when they and the centre had specifically requested meetings with enron in singapore and washington dc to discuss an "" amicable "" solution of the dabhol issue .
in a sudden move yesterday , the indian lenders - idbi , icici , ifci and state bank of india - filed a suit in the mumbai high court seeking a stay on termination proceedings by dpc . mr harish salve , counsel for the lenders , told the court today that the institutions had no way to protect their security other than approach the court .
the lenders want the court to stay the termination process and also a direction to re - start the first phase of the project which has been mothballed following the spat between dpc and maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .
mr salve told the court that the indian lenders had put in more than rs 6 , 000 crore , either through direct lending or guarantees , into the project . the lenders are caught between mseb , which has "" repudiated "" the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) , and dpc , which is proceeding "" as per the ppa "" .
on november 19 , a six - month "" cooling "" period after the serving of the first ptn expires , and dpc becomes eligible to serve the final termination notice ( ftn ) as per the ppa .
a third - party sale of the plant would not be possible once the company serves the ftn and mseb would be obliged to take over the plant . as per the ppa , in such a situation , mseb has to pay back the entire debt upfront . in the current circumstances , this is near - impossible , especially since mseb would not agree to the transfer of assets as it does not acknowledge the ppa .
fis fear that the company would serve the ftn any time after november 19 . if it does , the chances of tata power or bses ltd - currently the only two contenders for the project - acquiring the project may vanish .

in a day of dramatic developments , the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) initially decided against attending a meeting convened by the indian financial institutions in singapore in retaliation to a case lodged against it at the bombay high court , but subsequently , reversed its stand .
"" the indian government and the institutions informed us that there will be a new proposal from the latter to buy enron ' s equity in dabhol power company , "" said a senior official of dpc .
fi sources , though , confirmed that dpc representatives had agreed to attend the meeting in singapore , but denied that they had agreed to come up with a new proposal to buy enron ' s equity . "" it is going to be a closed door meeting where various issues will be discussed , "" they said , but declined to reveal further details .
earlier in the day , dpc had issued a statement saying that it had called off the scheduled meeting with the indian financial institutions in singapore on thursday and friday following a case lodged in the bombay high court by the latter .
indian financial institutions and banks had filed a case in the high court pleading for an injunction against dpc . they had asked the court to restrain dpc from serving the final termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . earlier this week , dpc had served a transfer of assets notice , thereby , setting the stage for serving the final termination notice .
tata power and bses , the two companies which have evinced keen interest in buying enron ' s 65 per cent stake in dpc , are also slated to attend the meeting . the proposals of these two companies are likely to be discussed at the meeting .
earlier , dpc had said it was "" disappointed "" with the legal action taken by the indian lenders . dpc had also expressed surprise that the legal action had been initiated on the eve of prime minister atal behari vajpayee ' s visit to the us .

dynegy holds talks to buy enron , inject $ 1 . 5 billion to shore up firm

dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
dynegy inc . , the houston - based energy trading and power company , was attempting to strike a deal wednesday evening to buy enron corp . , its beleaguered hometown rival , for $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion in stock , the wall street journal reported .
because any merger of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months and enron ( ene ) needs to shore up its beleaguered finances now , dynegy ( dyn ) also is expected to inject $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately , people familiar with the matter said .
chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) , which owns a 26 % stake in dynegy , is expected to provide dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations . chevrontexaco then will inject another $ 1 billion into the combined company once the deal is concluded so that its stake in dynegy isn ' t substantially reduced .
under the terms being worked out wednesday night , enron chairman kenneth lay would have a seat on the combined company ' s board , but wouldn ' t hold any formal management position , said the people familiar with the matter . mr . lay may take on a consulting role .
the boards of dynegy , chevron and enron were meeting wednesday to discuss a potential deal , but a seesawing enron stock price and the complexity of a transaction yet could derail a deal , people familiar with the matter warned .
several important points , including the exchange ratio , were still being worked out , but dynegy is expected to pay a very modest premium for enron ' s stock , arguing that enron shareholders will benefit from the upside of combining the two companies .
enron also is expected thursday to disclose more financial dealings about the controversial partnerships . spokesmen from enron and dynegy declined to comment .
if approved by regulators , the deal would be a stunning development for enron , which transformed itself from a staid natural - gas - pipeline company into a highflying power trading giant only to see its share price - - and hefty market valuation - - plummet in a matter of weeks .
enron has been scrambling for days to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies . the company desperately needs to win back its credibility on wall street following the disclosure that the securities and exchange commission was investigating the partnerships created to serve as a hedge against fluctuating market conditions . discussions between dynegy and enron began about 10 days ago , but intensified last weekend .
should enron strike a deal , it hopes to stabilize its stock price . enron fell 6 . 4 % , or 62 cents , to $ 9 . 05 at 4 p . m . composite trading on the new york stock exchange . at one point wednesday morning , enron ' s stock had fallen 25 % on news reports that enron ' s efforts to line up investors had failed . the stock recovered after cnbc and dow jones newswires reported the talks with dynegy . the shares are at a new 52 - week low and far from the 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 .
dynegy fell $ 3 , or 8 . 3 % , to $ 33 , at 4 p . m . in big board trading . however , some investors believed the company ' s share price could benefit from the deal .

usa : wrapup 2 - enron , dynegy in merger talks .
by andrew kelly
11 / 07 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 7 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . is in talks to buy troubled enron corp . in a deal that would involve a stock swap and a $ 1 . 5 billion capital infusion from chevrontexaco , which has a big stake in dynegy , a source close to the talks said on wednesday .
the deal , which could be announced officially this week , was expected to give what the source called a "" modest premium "" to enron shareholders , whose stock has plummeted in value as a fast - moving financial crisis enveloped the company .
for dynegy , the merger would catapult it to the top of the energy trading industry now dominated by enron . last year , the company had $ 29 billion in revenues , compared to $ 100 billion for enron .
for enron , it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace for a company that not long ago was ballyhooed as one of the world ' s most innovative , not to mention profitable .
the source said the form of chevrontexaco ' s capital infusion was not yet clear . chevron , which recently merged with texaco , was one of dynegy ' s founding investors and still owns 26 . 5 percent of the company .
stock hammered
enron has seen its stock hammered and credit ratings lowered in recent weeks after reporting its first quarterly loss in four years and taking a $ 1 . 2 billion equity writedown linked to financial transactions under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
enron shares , which traded as high as $ 90 in august of last year , dropped to a 10 - year - low of $ 7 during wednesday ' s trading session before rallying on news of the dynegy talks .
the stock ended down 62 cents at $ 9 . 05 on volume of 72 . 4 million shares , the day ' s most active issue on the new york stock exchange . dynegy stock fell $ 3 to $ 33 .
enron , the nation ' s largest trader of natural gas and electricity , has been under fire for failing to explain off - balance sheet transactions conducted with partnerships run by ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow . investors said they reeked of conflict of interest and demanded a full explanation they never got .
fastow left the company last month in what has become a growing line of high - profile departures from enron , topped by the august resignation of chief executive jeff skilling after just six months on the job .
the crisis has undermined confidence in enron ' s financial stability , which in turn has forced the company to seek cash and credit to back the energy trading operations that provide most of its revenue and earnings .
the new york times said on wednesday enron had approached at least a dozen buyout firms and investor warren buffett , chairman of berkshire hathaway inc . . , but none took the bait .
analysts have said would - be investors are wary because no one knows what financial liabilities , if any , lurk in enron ' s labyrinthine books .
firesale
but andre meade of commerzbank securities said the firesale price for enron apparently was too attractive to pass up .
"" certainly , enron at $ 9 a share appeals to some energy companies . dynegy appears to be one of them and is looking at putting something together , "" he said .
in contrast to dynegy , rival el paso corp . said on wednesday it wanted no part of enron , except perhaps for a few hard assets . el paso also said enron was perhaps neither as big or important to markets as analysts believe .
"" if enron goes away , which we don ' t think is going to happen and we hope it doesn ' t happen , we don ' t see the market missing a beat , frankly , "" ralph eads , head of el paso ' s merchant energy business , told a meeting of analysts .
eads said el paso calculates that enron accounts for about 10 percent of trading in u . s . wholesale gas and power , well below the 25 percent usually attributed to them by analysts .
at least one company , apache corp . , said it ended some hedging agreements because of concerns about increasing risk in the energy derivatives market caused by the enron crisis .
pat wood , chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission , told reporters the agency was keeping an eye on the markets , watching for an enron effect .
"" we ' re watching the impact that enron or any other firm would have on the overall workings of the market , but we ' re not intervening where other agencies have jurisdiction , "" he said .
copyright ? 2000 dow jones bloomberg says chevron , which has a 27 % stake in dynegy , will add $ 1 . 5 billion to the deal .
the deal is expected to be a stock swap at a small premium to enron ' s wednesday closing price of $ 9 . 05 . enron was off 7 cents in after - hours trading while dynegy was up 34 cents , to $ 33 . 34 .
a merger would amount to a rescue of houston energy - trading giant enron , whose stock has plunged nearly 90 % in recent weeks after the company revealed that a shadowy deal caused a $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity .
the controversial deal is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission and has led to the ousting of the company ' s cfo , andrew fastow . the deluge of bad news has prompted other energy companies to reduce their dealings with enron , a serious development for a trading company .
dynegy ' s board was meeting wednesday afternoon to discuss the merger , while enron ' s board was scheduled to consider the combination wednesday evening . a dynegy spokesman declined to comment , citing a company policy of not commenting on market rumors . enron spokespersons did not return calls . chevron declined to comment .
chevron ' s involvement appears critical if the deal is to gain the approval of rating agencies . dynegy ' s balance sheet is not strong enough to acquire enron on its own . therefore , chevron is expected to raise its stake in dynegy and possibly make an immediate cash infusion into enron . the size of any infusions will be a good indication of how bad things have gotten at enron .
with the stock plummeting and enron facing a mounting debt crisis - - $ 12 billion in direct debt and nearly $ 9 billion in potential liabilities from affiliates - - the company is running out of options . it recently drew down about $ 3 billion in existing credit lines and gained an additional $ 1 billion in credit secured by its pipeline business . enron debt has been downgraded in recent days by the three main credit - rating agencies .
sources say a number of potential investors have been approached - - from warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway ( brka : nyse - news - commentary ) to royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse adr - news - commentary ) - - with little success . ? ? general electric ' s ( ge : nyse - news - commentary ) capital division is said to have held multiple talks with enron with no resolution . ? dynegy may be motivated by its significant exposure to enron . if enron had failed , dynegy could have faced serious disruption and large losses because the two firms are trading partners on a number of contracts . in such a relationship , dynegy could have contracts to purchase a commodity like power or natural gas from enron and be committed to sell that commodity to another buyer . if enron failed to deliver , the domino effect could have a significant economic impact on dynegy . while other energy trading firms have exposure , sources speculate dynegy ' s exposure is more significant than its peers . ? enron was down as much as 20 % during the day . dynegy stock was off 8 % in the regular session , while its bonds also skidded on rumors of a deal . ? ? ? azurix corp . closes sale of azurix north america ? ? 11 / 07 / 2001 ? pr newswire ?

if you wish to use sas , there are a few simple things you need to do :
1 ) you need to get a unix password if you don ' t already have one ( your user
id will be the same as on the nt network , but a different password is issued )
2 ) you need a program called "" exceed "" on your pc . request it from it ( you
already have this if you are already a user of lim on the unix platform )
3 ) you need an "" ftp "" program on your pc . you can go to www . download . com and
download one ( i like wsftp )
4 ) exceed is funny in the way it runs . when you invoke exceed ( or lim
advanced user ( under infobases ) if you already have this ) it will install
itself the first time , and will then "" disappear "" to the taskbar . you need to
* right * click on the taskbar on exceed , and then choose "" tools "" and "" client
startup "" and then "" new . ""
you will enter a box which should already be set for rexec and an xwindow
emulation . you need to specify the host type as sun , enter your user name and
password , set the host name to :
capers . ect . enron . com
and then , on the command line , type the following ( carefully ) :
/ usr / openwin / bin / xterm - display @ d
then , use the file menu to save this as capers . xs and then click on the run !
menu . within a second or two , a window will open up with you logged into the
serve capers . you are now on a unix server , and the directory is your home
directory . from here , if you simply type "" sas "" the 3 windows for an
interactive session with sas should open on your desktop . you are in business .
5 ) you also need to install your ftp . follow the procedures with the
software , and then create a new session called "" enron "" where you choose as
the server simply "" earth "" ( do not add any further descriptors such as
. enron . com ) . supply your user name and * unix * password , check the "" remember
password "" box , and the default communication setups should be correct ( eg ,
host type as "" automatic detect "" ) .
when you invoke ftp and connect to enron , it will put you in your home
directory on the unix system , the same directory your xwindow comes up in
under exceed .

confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -

mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3

sorry if there was any confusion in my email - it was not actually prompted
by your questions about enlighten , which haven ' t caused ripples and in any
case are appropriate questions to ask .
i ' m really trying to get commitment from business sponsors ( principally mike
on this side ) on both sides of the pond to agree a common timetable for
functionality . if we don ' t get this , it may be difficult for us to maintain
a common database across houston and london , and it will end up acting as a
broker between different business areas when establishing priorities . i
doubt any of us want that .
cheers

subject : re : enlighten common timetable
for global markets , we were not scheduled to get anything by the end of the
year from enlighten , envoice or dtl . but in order to establish what could
potentially be delivered by july 2001 , we were inquiring as to the data
elements that were going to be stored as well as the functionality . it would
be hard to make committments to use an application , without really knowing
what it does . clarification was what we were trying to get and will require ,
to do a true gap analysis so we can quantify the extent that these
applications fit or do not fit our business .
i received a functional spec for envoice today and would like to get one for
dtl and enlighten to get a better understanding of the scope of these and
possible enhancements that could be added on later .
i am sorry if my queries caused some "" ripples "" . i still would like some
tangible information to start looking at regarding these applications .
please let me know what information you can supply us . thanks cindy

subject : enlighten common timetable
dear all
there is currently some debate as to what is going to be delivered by
enlighten . some clarification and a question :
clarification :
enlighten ( certainly in london ) is actually a data hub , rather than an
application . in itself , it will not add business value . however , the tools
which sit on top of this system will add business value . these tools are
currently dtl , envoice , zebra . however , i think we all anticipate more
requirements being developed as this central data store becomes richer .
question ( for business sponsors ) :
we are trying hard to coordinate us and uk efforts . however , this will be
extremely difficult if our respective business timelines are not the same .
say - for example - mike wants enlighten to deliver volumetric reporting by
then end of 2000 but cindy instead wants a full dpr in the same timeline .
our data architects are going to struggle to coordinate and prioritise their
work if we are working for two separate sets of masters . so :
if we are really to reap the rewards of a uk / us implementation , a common
timetable is extremely important . who are our primary uk and us business
sponsors and can we ask them to agree a mutual timeline ? i suspect if we
are to try and make this a joint development , nothing will make delivery
harder than having separate and sometimes mutually exclusive sets of
requirements from our user communities .
comments / answers please . . .
cheers
