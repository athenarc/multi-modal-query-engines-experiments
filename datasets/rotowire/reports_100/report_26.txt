The Los Angeles Clippers (14 - 5) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (8 - 10) 120 - 100 on Saturday. Los Angeles has won seven straight games, coasting through arguably the easiest stretch of their schedule this season. Blake Griffin led the way with a game - high 30 points in 30 minutes. Chris Paul displayed his scoring and dishing talents, finishing with 18 points and 16 assists in 30 minutes. As a team, the Clippers shot 55 percent from the field and 53 percent from beyond the three - point line. They'll stay home to host the Phoenix Suns on Monday. New Orleans has dropped five of their last six games, reeling due to the absence of Eric Gordon, or simply a lack of cohesion on a team that is starting to appear as though it will fail to meet expectations for a second straight season. Gal Mekel made his Pelicans debut, dishing six assists in just 11 minutes of action off the bench. Anthony Davis finished with 26 points but corralled just three rebounds. The Pelicans will stay in Los Angeles to play the Los Angeles Lakers on the second game of their back - to - back set.
