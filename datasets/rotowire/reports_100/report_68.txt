The Cleveland Cavaliers (6 - 1) were able to stave off a late fourth - quarter surge from the Indiana Pacers (3 - 4), winning 101 - 97. Cleveland power forward Kevin Love dominated the glass against the thin Indiana froncourt, totalling 19 rebounds to go with 22 points and three blocks. Cavs Star LeBron James had a similarly dominant game, tallying 29 points, six rebounds, and four assists. Cleveland's win marks the sixth in a row for the Eastern-Conference powerhouse, despite the absence of All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving (knee). Indiana small forward Paul George continued his stretch of dominance against LeBron and the Cavs. George, coming off a 36 - point, 12 - rebound performance against the Heat, delivered a game - high 32 points to go with 11 rebounds and six assists. The All-Star missed the 2014 - 15 season with a fractured leg, but has n't skipped a beat in his return, averaging 23 points, 9 rebounds, and 5 assists per game through seven games so far this season. Indiana will look to recover from the loss as they take on the Magic at home in the second half of their back - to - back. Meanwhile, the red - hot Cavs will look to stretch their streak to seven games as they take on the Jazz on Tuesday in Cleveland.
