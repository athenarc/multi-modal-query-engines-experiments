The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 111 - 104, at Barclays Center on Sunday afternoon. The Mavericks (30 - 39) came into Sunday's contest in urgent need of a win, not only to keep pace behind the eighth - seeded Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference, but to also put the considerable bad taste of a 116 - 74 loss to the Sixers on Friday behind them. A matchup against the defensively - challenged Brooklyn Nets proved to be what the doctor ordered, as Dallas shot 54 percent from the field and used a 57 - 43 halftime lead as the foundation for the road victory. Dirk Nowitzki and J.J. Barea's 20 - point efforts from the starting five and bench, respectively, led the way, and modest but balanced efforts across the rest of the rotation helped the Mavs hold off the feisty Nets (13 - 56). Nowitzki contributed a near double - double of 23 points and nine rebounds. Barea was next with 20 points, seven assists, one rebound and two steals. Harrison Barnes tallied 19 points, six rebounds and two assists. Wesley Matthews supplied 15 points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal. Yogi Ferrell registered eight points, five assists, two rebounds, three steals and a block. Devin Harris was productive as a reserve as well with 11 points, two boards, one assist and one steal. Brook Lopez paced Brooklyn with a game - high 27 points, which he supplemented with seven boards. Spencer Dinwiddie followed with 18 points, seven dimes, two rebounds and one steal while leading the bench. Randy Foye registered 11 points, six rebounds, two assists and one steal. Quincy Acy matched Foye's point total and added three rebounds. Isaiah Whitehead poured in 10 points and added two boards and two assists. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson mustered a modest six points but also hauled in nine rebounds and recorded a block. The Mavericks head back home to face the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday evening, while the Nets remain home to tangle with the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday night as well.
