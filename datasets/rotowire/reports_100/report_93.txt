The Detroit Pistons earned an Eastern Conference road win Monday at Barclays Center as they defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 105 - 100. The Pistons took a 10 - point lead in the third quarter and looked poised to run away with it, but the Nets bench led by Andrea Bargnani put the Nets back on top early in the fourth quarter. It remained tight throughout the fourth quarter, as neither team managed more than a five - point lead at any point in the period, but Detroit's one - two punch of Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson proved to be too tough for the Nets. Drummond finished with his third double - double in his past four games as he scored a team - high 21 points and grabbed a game - high 18 rebounds, including seven on the offensive end. Jacksom scored 19 and dished out six assists, and Ersan Ilyasova and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 16 apiece. The Pistons shot poorly (43 percent) but used a ridiculous 19 offensive rebounds to keep their offense from going stagnant. Brook Lopez was ultra - efficient, as he scored a game - high 27 points on 13 - 19 shooting and grabbed five rebounds. Bargnani scored 18 off the bench on 7 - 12 shooting, but Wayne Ellington (4 - 11 FG, 3 - 5 3PT) was the only other Nets player to reach double - digits with 11. The Nets shot 49 percent from the floor, well above the Pistons' mark, but thanks to their work on the glass, Detroit took 16 more field goals (98) than Brooklyn (82), and that proved to be the difference in the game. The Pistons will continue their east coast road trip Wednesday in Boston. The Nets will continue their homestand with a Wednesday game against the Pacers.
