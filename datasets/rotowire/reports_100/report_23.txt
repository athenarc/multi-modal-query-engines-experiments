It was another day at work on Tuesday for superstar James Harden, who led the Rockets to a blowout victory with 34 points and 11 assists. "The Beard" ranks fifth in the NBA in scoring at almost 28 points per game, and also leads the league in assists. On Tuesday, it was business as usual for the elite point guard, who shot 9 - of - 16 from the field, made four three - pointers, and shot a perfect 12 - of - 12 from the free - throw line. With Harden at the helm, Houston's elite offense took off, scoring 123 points on 52 percent shooting and splashing in 17 three - pointers. Power forward Ryan Anderson was a major factor as well, scoring 22 points and pouring in four threes of his own. For Dallas, meanwhile, offense did not come as easily. The team shot just 41 percent from the field on the night. Veteran star Dirk Nowitzki played limited minutes, scoring only seven points on 2 - of - 8 shooting in 15 minutes played. Forward Harrison Barnes once again led the Mavs in scoring, this time with 21 points.
