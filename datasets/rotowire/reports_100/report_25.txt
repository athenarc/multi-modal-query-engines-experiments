The New Orleans Pelicans (37 - 30) escaped with an 85 - 84 win over the Milwaukee Bucks (34 - 33). Ersan Ilyasova missed a wide - open, game - winning three - pointer at the buzzer. The Pelicans claimed the eight seed in the Western Conference, holding the tiebreaker over the Oklahoma City Thunder, who possess the same record.

In 42 minutes, Davis finished with 20 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, three blocks and one steal. Tyreke Evans scored 10 of his 12 points in the first quarter, combined with 10 rebounds, six assists and one steal in 37 minutes. Quincy Pondexter provided 18 points and five three - pointers. The Bucks lost their third straight and eight of their last ten. They maintain a three and a half game lead over the Indiana Pacers and Miami Heat for the six seed. Michael Carter-Williams shot 2 - of - 12 in his return to the lineup after missing one game due to an ankle injury. Jerryd Bayless played 34 minutes off the bench following three missed games with his own ankle injury, supplying 14 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Jared Dudley (back) and O.J. Mayo (hamstring) didn’t play the first night of a back - to - back, and Miles Plumlee received a DNP-CD as coach Jason Kidd preferred his eight - man rotation. John Henson recorded four of the Bucks’ 12 blocks. The Pelicans begin a three - game road trip Thursday against the Phoenix Suns. The Bucks quickly turn around Wednesday with a home game against the San Antonio Spurs before going back on the road.
