Despite the Sacramento Kings losing four straight games coming into Sunday and the Toronto Raptors winning five of six, Sacramento was able to pull out a 96 - 91 road win. DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay once again carried the load for the visitors, as they have been the Kings' top two scorers in every game they've both played this season. This was actually the first game that at least two other starters scored in double figures for the Kings for the entirety of the season. The Raptors stars really struggled shooting, as Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan combined to go 12 - of - 36 in the loss. The 23 - point outing from DeMar DeRozan was his lowest of the season, as he hadnâ€™t scored below 32 points all year. With Jonas Valanciunas out of the lineup with a knee contusion, Toronto really struggled down low. In fact, they had no big man reach double figures in scoring or rebounding, while being outscored in the paint 52 - 30.
