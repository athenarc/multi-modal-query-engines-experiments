The Los Angeles Lakers (5 - 23) defeated the Denver Nuggets (11 - 17) 111 - 107 on Tuesday night. The game was a tale of two halves, as these teams showed why they have struggled so much this season. The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead, but blew it in the second half with some bad defense. The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game. The one bright spot was the bench, as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together. Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game. This was a brutal loss for Nuggets fans and they'll look to bounce - back on Wednesday when they take on the Phoenix Suns.
