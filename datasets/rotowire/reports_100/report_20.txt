Chris Paul racked up one of the rare monstrous double - double efforts this season after scoring 20 points and adding 20 assists. The Clippers point guard stepped up in the absence of Blake Griffin (knee) and contributed a hand in 60 of the teams 133 points. The majority of Paul's dimes came in the first three quarters, where he racked up 18, capped off by a Marreese Speights fourth quarter three with just over 5:0 remaining. Paul added five rebounds and three steals on 8 - of - 16 shooting in 30 minutes of action. The bench for the Clippers, once again, contributed a strong scoring effort, as both Jamal Crawford and Marreese Speights continue to make up one of the best bench duos in the league this year. Crawford finished with 22 points on 10 - of - 13 shooting, while Speights added 17 points on 17 points on 7 - of - 12 shooting.
