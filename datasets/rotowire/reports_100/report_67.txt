The Golden State Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets, 121 - 94, to take a 3 - 1 lead in their Western Conference first - round playoff series Sunday at Toyota Center. Just before halftime, with the score tied 56 - 56, Warriors superstar Steph Curry slipped on a wet spot on the court and limped off with an apparent right knee injury. He attempted to warm up and return to the game but was unable to play in the second half with a right knee sprain. Houston point guard Patrick Beverley also suffered a sprained right leg and was also forcedd out of the game late in the first half. The Warriors, who won Game 2 without Curry, dominated the second half, as they won the third quarter 41 - 20 and were able to coast home in the final period. Even before the injury, Curry struggled in his 18 first half imnutes, as he scored just six points on 2 - 9 shooting (1 - 7 3PT). Klay Thompson shouldered the load for the Warriors with Curry out, as he led all scorers with 23 points (8 - 15 FG, 7 - 11 3PT). Andre Iguodala excelled in 23 minutes off the bench as well, with 22 points on a brilliant 9 - 11 shooting effort (3 - 4 3PT). Even without Curry, the Warriors' offense was cooking, as they shot over 50 percent from the field and from three - point land (21 - 40), and they recorded a brilliant 38 assists against just 16 turnovers. Dwight Howard led the Rockets with 19 points and added 15 rebounds, and James Harden posted his own double - doubble with 18 points and 10 assists to go with seven rebounds and seven steals. Michael Beasley added 17 points (6 - 12 FG) in just 19 minutes off the bench. But the Rockets struggled to distribute the ball, particularly in the second half after Beverley's injury, as they recorded as many assists as turnvoers with 18 apiece. With the Rockets' offense stagnating, the Warriors had no problem clamping down on the three - point line, as Houston shot just 5 - 27 (19 percent) from deep. The Warriors and Rockets will face off in Game 5 Wednesday in Oakland at 10:30 PM Eastern Time.
