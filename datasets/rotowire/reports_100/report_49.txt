While the Warriors have seen some cold shooting nights so far this season, Friday's matchup saw the worst splits for the team in recent memory. Reigning MVP Steph Curry went 0 - for - 10 from beyond the arc, failing to hit a three - pointer for the first time in 157 games. As the NBA record fell, Curry's backcourt partner Klay Thompson saw struggles of his own, going just 2 - of - 10 from downtown. On the whole, the Warriors went just 5 - of - 32 from beyond the arc, their lowest three - point output of the season. Rebounding proved to be another major factor in the game. Los Angeles forward Julius Randle pulled down a season - high 14 boards, helping to give the Lakers a 51 - 40 rebounding advantage. Sophomore Larry Nance Jr. also provided a force in the paint, contributing nine rebounds and 12 points on perfect shooting.
