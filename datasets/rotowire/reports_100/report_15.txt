The Washington Wizards (36 - 37) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (15 - 58) 101 - 88 at Staples Center on Sunday. Washington ended a short, but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road, and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards played at a high speed pace, led by John Wall, who diced through the Lakers defense and took advantage of his matchup with D’Angelo Russell. Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own. Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game. Bryant finished with 17 points, one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting, but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times, which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game. The Lakers will visit the Utah Jazz (36 - 37) on Monday, while the Wizards will head north to take on the Golden State Warriors (66 - 7).
