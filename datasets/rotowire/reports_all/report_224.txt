The San Antonio Spurs (27 - 6) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (11 - 20) Monday 101 - 95 at AT & T Center in San Antonio. The Spurs continued their dominance at home, as they extended their home winning streak to start the season to 18 games, but this one didn’t come easy, as the young and improving Timberwolves put up a fight for 48 minutes. It wasn’t San Antonio’s most impressive outing, but it was once again their balanced play that led them to victory, as six players scored in double figures. Kawhi Leonard continues to play like an All-Star, as he led the way with a double - double of 17 points and 11 rebounds in 37 minutes. Boba Marjanovic matched Leonard’s 17, recording as many in just 15 minutes off the bench while shooting 7 - for - 7 from the field. Manu Ginobili (13), Tony Parker (12), David West (11) and Patty Mills (11) round out the six Spurs who scored in double figures. Andrew Wiggins led the way scoring for Minnesota in the losing effort, posting 18 points and six rebounds in 37 minutes, while rookie star Karl-Anthony Towns recorded a double - double of 10 points and 12 boards in 31 minutes. Additionally, while Ricky Rubio struggled shooting from the field (2 - of - 9) and finished with just seven points, he did manage to dish out 14 assists to just one turnover on the night. Zach LaVine also had a solid outing off the bench, scoring 15 points in 25 minutes. Up next, the Spurs will stay home Wednesday to take on the Suns, while the T’Wolves will return home Wednesday to play the Jazz.
