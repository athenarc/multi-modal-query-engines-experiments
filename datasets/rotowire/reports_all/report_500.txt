A home - and - home set is almost always split with the home teams winning both games and that was just the case here. Both games were tight too, with both matchups being decided by five points or less. The game scripts were different though, as there were only six combined lead changes and ties on Saturday, after having 39 on Friday. Jeremy Lamb was the surprise star for the Hornets, as he made his first start of the year in the absence of Nicolas Batum. Lamb finished the game with a season - high 18 points and a career - high 17 rebounds. Kemba Walker led the team in scoring though, providing 28 points, three assists and three steals. After Carmelo Anthony dropped a season - high 35 points on Friday, Anthony went just 7 - of - 25 from the field here en route to 18 points. Derrick Rose also scored 18 points, adding eight rebounds and eight assists in one of his best games of the season.
