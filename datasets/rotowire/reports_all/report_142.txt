The short - handed Atlanta Hawks (47 - 12) notched their league - leading 47th win of the season Saturday, defeating the Miami Heat (25 - 33) 93 - 91 at the American Airlines Arena. When Kent Bazemore buried a three - pointer with just over a minute left in the fourth, the air went out of the American Airlines Arena. The Heat recovered from a 15 - point deficit in the first half to make this game competitive, but the comeback effort fell short. The game got off to a rocky start, with the Hawks leading 17 - 12 at the end of the first quarter. The Hawks rested starters Demarre Carroll, Jeff Teague, and Al Horford for this contest, but the reserves stepped up in their absence. Dennis Schroder and Kent Bazemore had 16 and 15 points respectively as the Hawks staved off a late charge from Miami. Atlanta has gotten back on track with four consecutive victories after being blown out by Toronto in its first game back from the break. Along with Schroder and Bazemore's big outings, John Jenkins contributed 12 points and seven rebounds. Elton Brand stepped into the starting lineup and added seven points and eight rebounds. The Hawks will return to action Tuesday against the Rockets. Miami lost its second game in as many nights as it fell to Atlanta for the third time this season on Saturday. Hassan Whiteside's incredible 14 - point, 24 - rebound outing was n't enough to negate Miami's poor shooting effort. Miami finished the game shooting just 40 percent from the floor and 7 - for - 26 from beyond the arc. The Heat's loss allows several teams to gain ground on them in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Miami is idle Sunday before hosting Phoenix on Monday.
