The Orlando Magic (19 - 13) outlasted the Brooklyn Nets (9 - 23) in a tight one Wednesday night at the Amway Center, 100 - 93. It all came down to a wild fourth quarter which included three ties and five lead changes. A Tobias Harris layup with 16 seconds to go gave the Magic a 94 - 93 lead they would not relinquish. Nikola Vucevic led the Magic with 20 points on 9 - 18 shooting and added nine rebounds, including five on the offensive glass. The Magic pulled down 17 offensive rebounds as a team, the main reason they managed to escape with the win despite a 44 percent shooting night. Evan Fournier added 17 points and shot 3 - 8 from three - point land. Nets center Brook Lopez finished with game highs in points (24) and rebounds (15) as he earned his third consecutive double - double. Began Bogdanovic scored 20 points, but was part of the Nets’ struggles from three - point range, as he shot 1 - 6 from three and the team managed just 3 - 20 (15 percent). The Nets have won just two of their last 10 and finish a three - game road trip Saturday against Boston. The Magic have now won four of five and will try to stay hot New Year’s Day against the Wizards in Washington.
