While the 76ers won and ended their eight - game losing streak, they by no means put together a perfect performance. In fact, the game's result simply came down to the fact that even in spots where Philadelphia struggled, the Pelicans somehow found a way to be worse. The 76ers shot a fairly poor 43 percent overall from the field, while the Pelicans managed to shoot just 39 percent. Philadelphia struggled to make it to the free throw line, shooting just 13 attempts and only making nine of them (69 percent). And while New Orleans did get to the line more often, shooting 25 shots from the charity stripe, they made just 68 percent of those. Where the Pelicans excelled was in taking care of the basketball, committing just 12 turnovers on the night, but the 76ers still found a way to be better there, committing just 10 turnovers.
