The New York Knicks (30 - 43) took down the shorthanded Chicago Bulls (36 - 35) for the second straight night on Thursday, winning 106 - 94. Though not mathematically eliminated, the Knicks remain squarely out of the Eastern Conference playoff picture. However, the team has now won two straight after a back - to - back against the ailing Bulls. All-Star Carmelo Anthony led the team with 26 points, also pulling down seven rebounds. Rookie Kristaps Porzingis also had a big night, notching a 19 - point, 10 - rebound double - double. The Latvian big man also swatted three shots en route to the win. The Bulls have been grappling with major injuries for months, and Thursday was no exception. Key players Pau Gasol and Tony Snell both sat, allowing big man Cristiano Felicio to slide into the starting lineup despite his average of just 7 minutes per game on the season. The Bulls recorded a paltry 15 assists on the night, and the Chicago bench combined for just 20 in the contest. Despite these shortcomings, former MVP Derrick Rose did shine with a big 30 - point scoring night. The Bulls now sit 2 games behind the Pistons in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Knicks will host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday, while the Bulls will travel to Orlando to take on the Magic.
