The Utah Jazz (18 - 33) jumped out to an earlier lead and never let up, beating the Sacramento Kings (17 - 32) 102 - 90. Darren Collison did n't play after suffering a hip flexor strain Thursday night against the Dallas Mavericks. It's unlikely he'll play Sunday against the Phoenix Suns. Joe Ingles did n't play, and Elijah Millsap started in his void. Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors combined to score 50 points, and Enes Kanter provided 17 points and 13 rebounds in 33 minutes. Rudy Gobert fouled out, but not before swatting two shots. Steve Novak played in his first game since January 18th. Ramon Sessions started over the ailing Darren Collison, providing 11 points, four rebounds and five assists in 31 minutes. Ben McLemore scored 15 points on 15 shots, and Reggie Evans grabbed 11 rebounds. Prior to fouling out, DeMarcus Cousins supplied 27 points, 10 rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Rudy Gay was limited to four points on 1 - of - 8 shooting. The Jazz begins a two - game road trip Monday against the New Orleans Pelicans. Sacramento travels back home to face the Phoenix Suns on Sunday before embarking on a two - game road trip.
