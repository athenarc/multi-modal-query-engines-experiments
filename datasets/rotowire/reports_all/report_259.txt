Two of the NBA's hottest teams met on Wednesday night as the Boston Celtics (32 - 23) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (35 - 18) in overtime, 139 - 134. For Boston, the win was the second half of a back - to - back after Milwaukee snapped the team's four - game win streak on Tuesday. Despite the demoralizing last - second loss, the Celtics were able to come out and play against the contending Los Angeles Clippers the next day. It proved to be a point guard battle, as All-Star Isaiah Thomas led the team with a season - high 36 points while also dishing out 11 assists. Big man Jared Sullinger also had one of his strongest outings of the season, scoring 21 points on 10 - for - 15 shooting while also pulling down 11 rebounds and notching seven assists. While they got the win, the normally defense - oriented team allowed 134 points and let the Clippers convert 52 percent of shots from the field. Los Angeles had won seven of their last eight headed into Wednesday's contest. The absence of superstar Blake Griffin (hand) has n't stopped the Clippers from becoming one of the hottest teams in the NBA since the start of the new year. Much of their success can be attributed to veteran Chris Paul, who led the team again on Wednesday with 35 points and dished out 13 assists. Guard J.J. Redick also had a big night, scoring 27 points. Both teams will enjoy a long rest as the NBA heads into the All-Star break this weekend.
