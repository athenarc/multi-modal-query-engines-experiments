The Clippers (49 - 25) defeated the Celtics (32 - 41) 119 - 106 at TD Garden on Sunday. The Clippers’ J.J. Redick scored the first points of the game, knocking down a three - point jumper on Los Angeles’ first possession. That was the story all night long, as Redick finished with a team - high 27 points, going 5 - for - 6 from beyond the arc in 33 minutes. The Clippers never gave up the lead. At halftime they led by 21 points, and, going into the fourth quarter, they were up 105 - 79. The Clippers shot 49 percent from three - point range, while the Celtics shot 26 percent. The Clippers went to the line almost twice as much as the Celtics, attempting 40 free throws compared to Boston’s 23. And the Clippers pulled down 13 more boards than the Celtics over the course of the game. The Clippers’ Blake Griffin and Chris Paul each had 21 points. Paul went 3 - for - 4 from three - point land and contributed three rebounds, 10 assists, two steals and one block in 35 minutes. DeAndre Jordan had 15 points (6 - 8 FG), 14 rebounds and one steal in 29 minutes. The Celtics’ Isaiah Thomas came off the bench to lead the team in scoring with 19 points. Thomas went 4 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 7 from three - point range in 26 minutes of play. Thomas (back) only scored four points against the Heat on Wednesday after an eight - game absence.

Kelly Olynyk had 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt), five rebounds, two assists and one steal in 22 minutes. The Clippers are fifth in the Western Conference and have clinched a playoff birth. Boston has lost five of its last seven and is currently ninth in the Eastern Conference. However, they’re only a half - game behind the eighth - place Nets. The Clippers have finished the season 3 - 1 against the Celtics.
