The Portland Trail Blazers (35 - 32) defeated the Orlando Magic (28 - 37) 121 - 84 at Moda Center on Saturday. The Blazers won by the definition of team effort and the scoring outburst from their bench. Granted, the Magic were thin in terms of talent, as Elfrid Payton (elbow), Brandon Jennings (achilles) and Nikola Vucevic (groin) were all out for the game. Portland dominated every quarter of play and went into the half with a 21 point lead, and the efficient shooting as a whole kept Orlando out of striking distance throughout the final two quarters. The Blazers were led by Damian Lillard, who fell below scoring average, which is good for fifth in the league this year, but still turned in 19 points, 10 assists and four rebounds on 6 - of - 11 shooting. C.J. McCollum added 18 points on 8 - of - 17 shooting, to go along with three assists and one board. The starters kept the Magic at bay, but the bench added fuel to the fire in turning this game into a blowout. Gerald Henderson, Allen Crabbe and Meyers Leonard each played 20 - plus minutes, and combined 42 points on 15 - of - 23 shooting. Dewayne Dedmon and C.J. Watson started alongside Evan Fournier, Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo, but their lowly five combined points showed how thin the Magic are as a unit. Oladipo led Orlando in scoring, as he contributed 18 points, one assist and one rebound, while Gordon totaled 17 points, three dimes and four boards. The Blazers will visit the Oklahoma City Thunder (44 - 23) on Monday, while the Magic host the Denver Nuggets (27 - 38) on Tuesday.
