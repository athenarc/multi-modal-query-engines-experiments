The Chicago Bulls (42 - 28) defeated the Toronto Raptors (41 - 28) 108 - 92 on Friday in Chicago. Nikola Mirotic continues to act as the best player on this Bulls team as of late, as Friday night he scored a game - high 29 points on 11 - of - 21 shooting, grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked four shots in 32 minutes. Injuries have plagued Chicago, and it has been Mirotic's play that has allowed the Bulls to continue winning regardless. Mike Dunleavy scored 21 points on 8 - of - 13 shooting in 29 minutes and has also stepped up his game as of late, scoring 42 points in his last two outings. Joakim Noah was just two points shy of a triple - double, recording eight points on 4 - of - 7 shooting, 14 assists and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. Paul Gasol put up 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists in 28 minutes, while Aaron Brooks had 11 points, six rebounds and five assists in 33 minutes. Taj Gibson returned to the rotation Friday after missing the previous 10 games with an ankle injury. He played only 10 minutes and scored six points. Jimmy Butler (elbow) is practicing and is set to return soon, while Derrick Rose (knee) remains out but is on schedule in his recovery. As a team, the Bulls shot an impressive 53 percent from the field and the win pushes them ahead of Toronto for third place in the Eastern Conference, and they stand 3 games behind the Cavaliers for second. DeMar Derozan lead the way for the Raptors in the losing effort, recording 27 points on 8 - of - 14 shooting, seven rebounds and three assists in 37 minutes. Unfortunately for Toronto, the rest of the team was unable to contribute much more, as Greivis Vasquez served as the only other starter who scored in double figures, putting up 11 points, six assists and four rebounds in 37 minutes. Vasquez got the start after Kyle Lowry was ruled out prior to the game with a back injury. Patrick Patterson scored a solid 17 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting in 25 minutes off the bench, but as a team, the Raptors shot a poor 38 percent from the field. The loss moves them back into fourth place in the East, where they hold just a half - game lead over the Wizards for fifth. Up next, the Bulls will travel to Detroit Saturday to take on the Pistons, while Toronto will play the Knicks at home on Sunday.
