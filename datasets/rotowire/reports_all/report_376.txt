The Washington Wizards (23 - 27) fought off a second - half rally from the New York Knicks (23 - 32) to win 111 - 108 at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. Despite being outscored by 13 in the third quarter, Washington was able to narrowly pull out a win in the game's final minutes. All-Star point guard John Wall not only led the Wizards in scoring with 28, but dished out his second - highest assist total of the season with 17. Wall played a whopping 43 minutes in four quarters and turned the ball over just once despite being the focal point of the Washington offense. Meanwhile, Wall's backcourt partner in crime Bradley Beal drilled five three - pointers and poured in 26 points overall. Beal shot a disappointing 5 - for - 9 from the free - throw line, but more than made up for it with his impressive shooting from the field (8 - of - 14) and his stellar defense (four steals). Overall, Washington won with a lights - out shooting performance from beyond the arc, as the team shot 16 - for - 26 from deep. Rebounding, however, proved to be an issue for the Wizards, as they pulled down just 32 boards to New York's 46. Superstar Carmelo Anthony was unsurprisingly the leader for his team on Tuesday, as he posted a game - high 33 points to go along with 13 rebounds. Melo hit three three - pointers and was perfect from the line, helping his team post an impressive 53 percent from the field. Anthony saw help in the form of Latvian rookie Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 20 points and blocked three shots. The Knicks struggled, however, to match their opponents' heat from beyond the arc, as they shot just 31 percent from three - point territory. The Wizards will see their last contest before the All-Star break on Thursday as they visit Milwaukee. The Knicks, meanwhile, are done until after the break. They resume action in Brooklyn on Feb. 19.
