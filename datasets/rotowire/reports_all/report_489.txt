The Phoenix Suns (32 - 30) defeated the Orlando Magic (19 - 43) on Wednesday. Brandon Knight had his best game since being acquired in a deadline deal from the Milwaukee Bucks. Knight finished Wednesday's contest with 28 points on 10 - of - 12 from the field. He also had seven assists and three steals, one of which was with less than five seconds remaining when he was guarding the inbounder Willie Green. Knight was immediately fouled by Green, and then sank two free throws to secure the victory. Alex Len was available to play, as he was not suspended for his scuffle with Hassan Whiteside in Monday's game with the Miami Heat. Len ended with two points and four rebounds in 22 minutes against Orlando. Victor Oladipo put on a show but it was n't enough to overcome an 11 - point deficit in the fourth quarter. He scored 17 of his 38 points in the final period, helping the Magic cut the Suns' lead to one point on two separate occasions in the last minute of the game. Oladipo had four rebounds, three assists and three steals to go along with seven costly turnovers. Dewayne Dedmon started at power forward for the Magic in place of Channing Frye who was moved to a reserve role for Wednesday's game. Dedmon finished with eight points, eight rebounds and one block in 21 minutes. Frye played 15 minutes and had four points, four rebounds and a block. Orlando will host the Sacramento Kings on Friday, as the Suns will head to Brooklyn to take on the Nets.
