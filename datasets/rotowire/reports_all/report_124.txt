In has n't been the prettiest 19th season for 38 - year - old power forward Dirk Nowitzki, and his performance in Monday's loss against the Thunder was yet another example of that. For the second straight game, Nowitzki failed to score in double figures, as he finished with just eight points on 3 - of - 9 shooting from the field in 25 minutes. He has now combined to score just 17 points and shoot 7 - of - 20 from the field over his last two games - - both of which have been losses for the Mavericks. It was the 12th time this season where Dirk has failed to score at least 10 points, and while he is n't the the same player he was in his All-Star prime, it still has had a negative impact on the team, as they are just 4 - 8 in those 12 outings.
