The Portland Trail Blazers (20 - 26) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (9 - 37) 121 - 103 at Moda Center on Saturday. Los Angeles fell behind early, and aside from a late second quarter run, they were never able to come within striking distance. It proved to be another Kobe Bryant filled atmosphere, as the 20 year veteran played his last game in Portland. Bryant finished with 10 points on nine shots. No Lakers player received more than 30 minutes of playing time, and coach Byron Scott experimented with a variety of lineups throughout the game. Dâ€™Angelo Russell put forth one of his best campaigns during his rookie season and finished with 21 points (8 - of - 12 FG, 1 - of - 2 3PT, 4 - of - 5 FT), three rebounds and two assists coming off the bench. Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson combined for 26 point, while Julius Randle added 11 points and nine rebounds. The Lakers are now owners of a six game losing streak. Los Angeles will host the Dallas Mavericks (25 - 20) on Monday. Portland entered the contest with a major matchup advantage in the backcourt and Damian LIllard and CJ McCollum shot lights out as a result. Lillard led all scorers with 36 points (14 - of - 19 FG, 5 - of - 8 3PT, 3 - of - 4 FT) and constantly kept the Lakers out of reach. McCollum added 28 points on 50 percent shooting and the combo guards were simply too much to handle, as it helped the Blazers successfully outrun their opponents, both in transition and in the half court offense. Portland dominated the glass and won the rebounding battle 42 - 30, led by a balanced mix of starters and bench players. Mason Plumlee totaled 13 points and eight rebounds, Noah Venloe added 11 points and six rebounds and Ed Davis contributed eight boards off the bench. Portland will host the Sacramento Kings (20 - 23) on Tuesday.
