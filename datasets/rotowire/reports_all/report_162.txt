The Charlotte Hornets (18 - 20) snapped a seven - game losing streak with a decisive 107 - 84 win over the Atlanta Hawks (23 - 16) on Wednesday. Charlotte was finally able to turn its luck around on Wednesday, as the team maintained a firm lead over Atlanta for the final three quarters. Point guard Kemba Walker led the team with 23 points, and also provided a strong defensive performance as he stole the ball three times. Backup Jeremy Lim provided a valuable spark off the bench for Charlotte, as he poured in 19 points and went 8 - for - 8 from the free - throw line. With center Al Jefferson (meniscus) still out, Cody Zeller was able to shine in his starting role, posting a 19 - point, 10 - rebound double - double along with three blocks. The Hornets simply dominated every aspect of the game, out - rebounding Atlanta 54 - 37 and shooting 7 percent better from the field. The Hawks, who came into the game well - rested and holding onto first place in the Southeast Division, simply could not make anything happen in Charlotte. All-Star forward Paul Millsap was the only Hawk to score in double - digits, as he led the team with 20 points. Overall, Atlanta struggled from the field, shooting just 37 percent on the night. In what was an unusual issue for Atlanta, a team known for its ball movement, the Hornets held a 26 - 17 advantage in team assists. Atlanta will look to get the ball moving better in a Friday night matchup against Milwaukee. Charlotte, meanwhile, will hope that its luck has changed for good, as it prepares to take on New Orleans on Friday.
