The Phoenix Suns (19 - 16) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (4 - 27) 112 - 96 on Friday the U.S. Airways Center in Phoenix. The Suns had a very strong second half on Friday, out - scoring the Sixers 55 - 37 over that span. They were able to use superior shooting all game, going 50 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line compared to the Sixers who shot 43 percent from the field and only 27 percent from beyond the arc. To add to that, the Suns also out - rebounded the Sixers 48 - 41 giving them even more of an advantage in securing a victory in front of their home crowd. The Suns were led by Markieff Morris and Gerald Green. Morris had a very strong game shooting the ball, going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 21 points in 21 minutes. He's now combined for 46 points over his last two outings, continuing to show the hot hand. Green on the other hand came off the bench for 21 points (9 - 15 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt) of his own. He's been a consistent option for the Suns off the bench, as he's now averaging 14 points per game this year. Eric Bledsoe had a strong showing as well. He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also recording eight assists. Over his last four games he's averaging 22 points and 7 assists per game, so he's played a big part in the Suns' success. Goran Dragic had a double - double with 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Sixers' guards had a big day. Coming off the bench, Tony Wroten went off. He shot a ridiculous 10 - for - 19 from the field and 4 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 28 points. He's now averaging 17 points on the season. Michael Carter-Williams also had a solid all - around game. He finished with 17 points (8 - 20 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt), seven rebounds and five assists in 34 minutes. He had a very poor showing on Tuesday against the Golden State Warriors, where he had only four points in 38 minutes, so it was nice bounce back game for him. Henry Sims was another strong bench contributor. He went 6 - for - 7 from the field to score 16 points. He's combined for 35 points over his last two games despite averaging only 10 points on the season. The Suns' next game will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday, while the Sixers will travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Saturday.
