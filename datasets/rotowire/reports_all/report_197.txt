The Los Angeles Clippers (47 - 27) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (35 - 50) 99 - 79 on Wednesday. This game looked lopsided in the first quarter and it didnâ€™t get much better after that. The Clippers carried a 26 - point lead into the fourth quarter and dominated throughout. The key for Los Angeles was their defense, as they held Minnesota to under 35 percent shooting and forced them to commit 16 turnovers. To put that in perspective, Los Angeles committed just seven turnovers and shot 44 percent from the field. The Clippers continue to battle for playoff positioning and easy wins like this are a great momentum booster. Chris Paul was majestic, as he tallied 20 points, 16 assists and eight rebounds in the win. J.J. Redick also played well, as he amassed 17 points, three rebounds and three assists. No other player scored more than 11, but they got a nice rest with no one playing more than 30 minutes. Up next for the Clippers is a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday. Losses like this are expected with a young team like Minnesota and there are still things to take away. Karl-Anthony Towns led the team with 16 points, while also grabbing 11 boards. Andrew Wiggins really struggled though, as he collected just seven points and one assist, while committing six turnovers on 3 - for - 9 shooting. Minnesota will play the Utah Jazz in their next game on Friday.
