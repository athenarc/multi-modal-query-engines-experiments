Kyrie Irving's red - hot start continued Tuesday, with his 10 - for - 19 shooting tally from the field and 4 - for - 6 mark from beyond the arc leading the Cavs to record 52 and 50 percent success rates from the field and three - point range, respectively. Cleveland was markedly more efficient than the Rockets from the charity stripe, successfully converting 84 of their 31 free - throw attempts. They out - rebounded the Rockets by a 46 - 32 margin as well, in large part due to James and Tristan Thompson combining for half of that tally. The Rockets continue to lean heavily on Harden, who once again paced the team with 41 points while setting up another 30 - plus through his 15 assists. The remainder of the starting five outside of Eric Gordon continues to struggle to muster consistent offense, however, and went a combined 11 - for - 28 from the field.
