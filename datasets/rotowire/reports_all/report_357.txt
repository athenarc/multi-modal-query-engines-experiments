The Utah Jazz (20 - 34) beat the Portland Trail Blazers (36 - 18) 92 - 76 on Friday. The trade of Enes Kanter to the Oklahoma City Thunder has opened the way for Rudy Gobert to become the starting center for the Jazz. Gobert swatted away five shots and grabbed seven rebounds in 24 minutes Friday. Trey Burke gave the Jazz a tune off the bench, scoring 19 points on 9 - of - 20 shooting in 28 minutes.
