The Houston Rockets (29 - 13) defeated the Indiana Pacers (15 - 27) 110 - 98 on Monday at the Toyota Center. The Rockets were led by a huge performance from James Harden, who lit up the Pacers for his fourth 40 - point game of the season. Harden finished the game with a season - high 45 points, shooting 12 - of - 18 from the floor, 7 - of - 12 from beyond the arc, and 14 - of - 15 from the line. The MVP candidate also added seven assists and four steals. Indiana's struggles continued Monday as it lost its fifth straight game. George Hill was out yet again, marking his tenth consecutive absence. The Pacers have three more games left on their five - game road trip, with the next contest coming Wednesday against the Hawks. Houston rebounded nicely after being trounced by Golden State on Saturday. The Rockets are right in the mix for the third seed in the West, trailing the Grizzlies by just one game after Memphis fell at home to Dallas on Monday. Houston will have a chance to avenge its 25 - point defeat at the hands of the Warriors when they square off Wednesday night in Oakland.
