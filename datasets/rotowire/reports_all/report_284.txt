The Utah Jazz (8 - 8) came very close to toppling the Golden State Warriors (190) but the multi - pronged attack of the Warriors had the answer as they earned the victory and stayed perfect by beating the Jazz 106 - 103. Utah took the lead with 7:30 left in the fourth quarter after an 11 - 2 run but that is when Stephen Curry and the Warriors kicked it into another gear. Curry seemed to have an answer for almost every Utah bucket and when he missed a contested lay - up in the last minutes Draymond Green was there to clean up the mess. Derrick Favors had a great game for the Jazz and was clutch in the last few minutes. He finished with 23 points on 9 - 15 shooting, including 5 - 5 free throws, 10 rebounds, two assists and two steals. Gordon Hayward also performed well, totalling a team - high 24 points, along with six assists and four rebounds, in 37 minutes. Rudy Gobert posted a double - double with 13 points and 11 rebounds, while throwing down some monster alley - oops. Alec Burks was big 28 minutes off the bench, with 19 points on 8 - 15 shooting, two rebounds, two assists and two steals. The Warriors were forced to play this one right down to the wire and would have lost if Utah had hit their last second open shot attempt. Stephen Curry led the way in scoring for Golden State with 26 points on 9 - 20 shooting, 4 - 8 from downtown, six rebounds, five assists and two steals. Draymond Green contributed in many ways including 20 points, nine rebounds, seven assists and immeasurable hustle and energy. Klay Thompson shot 8 - 15 from the field and finished with 20 points, five rebounds, two assists and two blocks. Harrison Barnes sat out with an ankle injury. Next up Golden State will be in Charlotte Wednesday to play the second game of a seven game road trip, during which their epic run will surely be challenged. Utah will have a couple of days off before hosting Orlando on Thursday.
