The Portland Trail Blazers (17 - 4) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3 - 19) 98 - 86 on Tuesday. Portland is on a five - game win streak. LaMarcus Aldridge took home the game - high scoring honors for a second straight game, finishing with 23 points. The Blazers shot 49 percent from the field, compared to the Pistons' 35 percent from the field, which tells the gross part of the story as to how they came away with the win. They did n't sell the Pistons any buckets. Detroit has lost 13 straight games in what has been a nightmarish start to the season. Coach Stan Van Gundy has tried to be patient with his rotations and starting lineup, but the players have n't rewarded him with much in the win column. Greg Monroe's 22 - point, 10 - rebound double - double in 33 minutes off the bench was the only bright spot from the Pistons. They could have Jodie Meeks (back) make his season debut in Friday's game, and it'll be interesting to see if a single role player can help them dig out of the hole they've dug.
