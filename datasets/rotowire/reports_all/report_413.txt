For Dallas, Monday's win may have been the biggest of the season. The team took a balanced offensive approach to take down the Cavaliers. Five players shot at least 11 field goals and all five scored in double digits. Forward Harrison Barnes led the team with 24 points and 11 rebounds. The team held a major advantage in the turnover column, committing only nine while forcing Cleveland to turn the ball over 17 times. The Cavaliers, meanwhile, relied heavily on LeBron James and Kyrie Irving who combined for 40 shot attempts. Irving was a dismal 7 - of - 21 from the field and had six turnovers. James, meanwhile, led the team per usual with 23 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists. The outing was not enough to earn the win or make up for the absence of injured All-Star Kevin Love, however.
