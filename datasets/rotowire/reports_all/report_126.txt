The Bulls (29 - 16) held on to knock off the Mavericks (30 - 14) 102 - 98 in Dallas on Friday. Chicago held a 10 - point lead with just over four minutes to play, but Dallas would go on a run to close to the gap down the stretch. A Dirk Nowtizki jumper with 1:39 to play cut the lead to just six points, and a pair of Tyson Chandler free throws less than a minute later brought Dallas within four. After Taj Gibson split a pair from the line on the other end, Monta Ellis responded with a long two - point jumper plus the foul to bring the Mavs within two. Dallas smothered a Derrick Rose drive attempt with less than 10 seconds to play, but Rose was able to deflect the rebound out to the perimeter, and Dallas was forced to foul with 0 second remaining.
