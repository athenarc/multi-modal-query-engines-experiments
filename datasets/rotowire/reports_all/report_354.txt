The Houston Rockets (33 - 32) defeated the host Boston Celtics (39 - 27) 102 - 98, Friday evening at TD Garden. The Rockets entered looking to improved on their three - game lead over Utah for eighth in the West and did just that as they edged the Boston Celtics down the stretch. The Rockets have now won three straight on the road, including victories against top eastern teams, Toronto and now Boston. The Celtics had won their previous 14 games at TD Garden and had won seven of nine against the West coming into this game, but the Rockets managed to defy those trends as they snuck away with the win. Houston struggled shooting from deep in this one, hitting only 5 - 26 from long range and gave up 18 turnovers on the game; but on the other hand managed to keep the Celtics to just 37 percent shooting from the field. James Harden led all scorers as he finished with 32 points (9 - 19 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 13 - 15 FT), along with four assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block. However, Harden also gave up six turnovers in his 36 minutes on the court. Michael Beasley was huge in his second game with the Rockets, providing a solid boost off the bench. Beasley tallied 18 points (9 - 19 FG) and eight rebounds, in only 15 minutes, as the second highest scorer for the Houston. Dwight Howard was solid in the middle, with 12 points and 12 rebounds, in 35 minutes. Despite playing at home where they have had great success, the Celtics were not able to gather much momentum in this one. The Celtics averaged 112 points per game throughout their previous 14 home victories but were held much below that mark by a hungry Houston team. Meanwhile, Isaiah Thomas was not phased as he tallied a team - high 30 points (10 - 21 FG, 5 - 9 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), along with two assists and two rebounds, in 38 minutes. Jared Sullinger had a big night as well, with 24 points (9 - 18 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 7 FT), 12 rebounds, four assists and four steals, in 31 minutes, while Avery Bradley chipped in 16 points, in 38 minutes. However, other than Thomas, Sullinger and Bradley, the rest of the Celtics team accounted for only 28 points. The Celtics will now have a few days rest before they visit Indiana to play the Pacers on Tuesday. The Rockets will be back in action on Saturday, as they wind - up their current four - game road trip in Charlotte.
