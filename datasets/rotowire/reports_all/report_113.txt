The San Antonio Spurs (33 - 19) defeated the Indiana Pacers (20 - 33), 95 - 93, on Monday. The Spurs avoided losing back - to - back games once again, and have only lost to one opponent with a sub .500 record since the beginning of January. Matt Bonner got the start for San Antonio, after playing just 18 seconds in Sunday's 87 - 82 loss at the hands of the Toronto Raptors. He logged 12 minutes this time around but was the only Spur not to score a point. Head coach Gregg Popovich reached a milestone with the victory, achieving his 1000th win. With a grand under his belt, he and the Spurs will turn their attention to the Detroit Pistons, the lone team under .500 to beat them thus far in 2015. The Pacers' George Hill almost spoiled the party for Popovich and his former team. Hill missed a three - pointer with less than a second remaining that would have given his team a buzzer - beating game - winner at home. The contest had been tied when Indiana gave up a Marco Belinelli bucket with two seconds left, leaving Hill with limited time to try and win the game. The Spurs will continue their road trip Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons. Meanwhile, the Pacers will travel to New Orleans to face off with the Pelicans on Wednesday.
