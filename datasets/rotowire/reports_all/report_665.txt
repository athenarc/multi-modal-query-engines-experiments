The Los Angeles Clippers (7 - 4) defeated the Houston Rockets (5 - 4) 128 - 95 in Game 4 of their second - round playoff series on Sunday in Los Angeles. The game stayed relatively close in the first half, with the Clippers boasting just a six - point lead after 24 minutes. But then, Los Angeles opened up the third quarter on a 12 - 2 run, ultimately winning the quarter 43 - 25. The game was all but over, and the Clippers closed out the game easily. This was all despite the Rockets utilizing the "hack - a - Jordan” technique, which clearly was ineffective, Jordan shot an astounding 34 free throws Sunday night, making 14 of them and finishing with 26 points (6 - 7 FG) and 17 rebounds, which were game - highs in both categories. Blake Griffin was not too far behind, as he continued his strong play in the playoffs, posting 21 points (7 - 11 FG, 7 - 9 FT) and eight rebounds in 33 minutes. Chris Paul added a double - double of 15 points and 12 assists, while J.J. Redick put up 18 points (5 - 10 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt). Off the bench, it was the usual suspects for Los Angeles, with Jamal Crawford contributing 13 points in 27 minutes and Austin Rivers scoring 12 points in 24 minutes. As a team, the Clippers shot 49 percent from the field and a very impressive 42 percent from behind the arc. They also dished out 27 assists to just 10 turnovers and are one win away from the franchise’s first ever Western Conference Finals. As for the Rockets, the struggles continue. Dwight Howard personified those struggles Sunday night, as he scored just seven points (3 - 7 FG, 1 - 6 FT), grabbed six rebounds and fouled out of the game after playing only 18 minutes. James Harden was able to put together a solid stat line of 21 points (5 - 12 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 9 - 10 FT), eight rebounds and six assists in 32 minutes, but on the court, he still did not look as aggressive and energized as her normally would. Trevor Ariza had 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 4 - 8 3 Pt) and eight rebounds, while Jason Terry added 16 points in 27 minutes. Terrance Jones and Nick Johnson each added 10 points, and overall, it was a fairly forgettable night for the Rockets. With the “hack - a” strategy, Houston was never able to get in any offensive rhythm with all the stoppages of play, and they clearly suffered because of it. Game 5 is scheduled for Tuesday, with tip - off coming at 9:30 p.m. EST.
