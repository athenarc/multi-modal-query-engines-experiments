The Brooklyn Nets (27 - 38) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14 - 52) 122 - 106 on Monday at the Target Center in Minneapolis. While the Timberwolves have already been eliminated from playoff contention in the Western Conference, the Nets continue to stay alive for a shot in the East. With their second win in a row, the Nets now sit just two and a half games behind the Indiana Pacers for the final projected playoff seed, with plenty of games left in the season to make their way back into the mix. The Nets shot really well in this game, going 58 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at 47 percent from the floor, but an impressive 60 percent from deep. With Ricky Rubio still sidelined with an ankle injury, Zach LaVine continued to run as one of the starting guards for the second game in a row during Monday's loss. He took advantage of the start once again, finishing with 20 points (8 - 15 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt) and three assists in 31 minutes. He just recorded 18 points and six assists in Sunday's game against the Spurs, so LaVine has been making his case for extended playing time. Kevin Martin had a strong showing as well though, posting 20 points (7 - 16 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and six assists in 32 minutes. He's been shooting the ball well of late, especially from the three - point line, as he's combined to go 5 - for - 8 from beyond the arc over his last two games. The Timberwolves saw some impressive contributions from the bench as well. Chase Budinger had his shot locked in and scored 18 points (8 - 10 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt) in just 26 minutes, while Justin Hamilton posted 15 points (6 - 14 FG, 3 - 3 FT) and six rebounds as well. Despite a season scoring average of 4 points on the year, he 'picked his game up recently and is averaging 14 points over his last four games, while playing extra minutes with so many injuries. The Nets' frontcourt did the bulk of the work for Brooklyn in the win, combining for 57 points. Joe Johnson led the way, as he went 10 - for - 14 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 22 points to go along with five rebounds in just 25 minutes. He's been hitting nearly everything lately, combining to go 16 - for - 24 from the field over his last two games. Thaddeus Young also had a strong showing, finishing with 19 points (8 - 17 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and three rebounds. Since joining the Nets 13 games ago, he's averaging 14 points, 5 rebounds, 1 assists and 2 steals while starting five of those games. Brook Lopez was the third member of the starting lineup in double figures, as he recorded 16 points on 7 - of - 8 shooting from the floor. Coming up big on the bench was both Jarrett Jack and Bojan Bogdanovic. Jack chipped in with 16 points (6 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and five assists, while Bogdanovic added 21 points (10 - 15 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt) and four rebounds. The Nets' next game will be on the road against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Toronto to play the Raptors on Wednesday.
