The Sacramento Kings (5 - 9) secured their fourth win in six games in Orlando Saturday night, defeating the Magic (6 - 7) 97 - 91. All-NBA center DeMarcus Cousins continued a dominant string of performances, delivering 29 points and 12 rebounds along with a substantial defensive output of three steals and three blocks. The volatile Cousins was suspended for the Kings' Thursday matchup against the Heat for a forearm punch to Hawks center Al Horford. Aside from that absence, however, Cousins has been on a tear since returning from an injured achilles, posting five double - doubles and logging two 35+ point games. While many predicted a reduced role for Sacramento point guard Rajon Rondo upon the return of backup Darren Collison, coach George Karl instead elected to trot the two guards out alongside one another in Orlando. Rondo, who has been averaging an NBA-leading 10 assists per game, saw a team - high 42 minutes in Orlando. It seems that Karl is committed to keeping the veteran point guard a major part of the Kings' rotations. The story of the night for the Magic, meanwhile, was inconsistency behind the arc. The team shot just 29 percent from behind the three - point line, including 3 - for - 11 from shooting guard Evan Fournier. Orlando will hope to get back on track as they prepare for a difficult matchup against the conference - leading Cavs in Cleveland. Sacramento, on the other hand, has been picking up steam of late, and will hope to carry this momentum into their matchup against Charlotte on Monday.
