The Boston Celtics defeated the Miami Heat 112 - 104 Monday at AmericanAirlines Arena. The Celtics (10 - 7) continued to surge with heir fourth win in their last five games. They were led by point guard Isaiah Thomas, who, despite having a poor shooting performance from the field, managed to record 25 points, eight assists and four steals in 35 minutes, and his work has a floor leader propelled the Celtics to have 46 assists to just nine turnovers as a team. Fellow starters on the wing Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder recorded 18 and 17 points respectively, but it was the play of Boston's bench that really helped get them to victory, with four reserves managing to score 38 points Monday night. For Miami (5 - 12), they came into Monday's game depleted with injuries, with Dion Waiters (groin), Tyler Johnson (mouth) and Justise Winslow (wrist) all ruled out. Additionally, starting point guard Goran Dragic (elbow) and Hassan Whiteside (knee) were both listed as questionable but managed to play through their ailments. And they were very impressive despite the injuries, with Dragic posting 27 points and 17 assists and Whiteside posting his own double - double of 25 points on 10 - of - 13 shooting and 17 rebounds. Their efforts, however, were not nearly enough, as the team lacked much of an offensive punch outside of those two. They mainly lacked punch from the outside, as Miami shot just 6 - of - 30 from behind the arc as a team. Up next, the Celtics will look to keep rolling at home Wednesday against the Pistons, while the Heat will head to Denver on Wednesday and play the Nuggets.
