The Denver Nuggets defeated the New York Knicks, 127 - 114, at Pepsi Center on Saturday. With Carmelo Anthony returning to Denver, the Nuggets played with some serious motivation. Denver started out hot, as they led 33 - 22 after the first quarter and pulled out the rare wire - to - wire win. The Nuggets were clicking on offense all evening, shooting 56 percent from the field and assisting on 26 of their 50 made baskets. Rebounding was also key for Denver, as they won that battle, 41 - 35. The Nuggets also dominated in the paint, outscoring the Knicks, 68 - 32 in the interior. New York (14 - 13) got some great performances from their stud players, but it simply was n't enough with a lack of production from their "others".

Kristaps Porzingis finished the game with 22 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Brandon Jennings got the start for the ailing Derrick Rose and amassed 14 points, seven assists and three steals in the loss. Guillermo Hernangomez was a nice spark off the bench, totaling 17 points and 10 rebounds. The Knicks return to action on Tuesday in a home matchup against the Indiana Pacers for their next game. Denver (11 - 16) has now scored 259 points across their last two games and they hope it's the start of a special run. Emmanuel Mudiay had one of his best games of the season, accumulating 22 points, seven rebounds and five assists in the win. Nikola Jokic accrued 10 points, nine rebounds and five assists in just 20 minutes of action, as he battled foul trouble all game long. Will Barton and Kenneth Faried were huge off the bench, as they combined for 42 points, 15 rebounds, four assists and four blocks on 16 - of - 21 shooting.
