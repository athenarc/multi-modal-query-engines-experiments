The Houston Rockets defeated the visiting Phoenix Suns on Monday, 131 - 115. Houston (23 - 9) has surprised many by holding the third - best record in the Western Conference over a third of the way through the season. On Monday, the Rockets looked as strong as ever, due in large part to the strong play of superstar James Harden. Harden predictably took over the game, scoring 32 points and dishing out 12 assists, both team highs. Sixth man Eric Gordon, meanwhile, continued to be a key part of the Rockets' newfound high - paced offensive attack. Gordon had 15 points and hit three three - pointers. As a team, the Rockets had 15 three - pointers and shot an impressive 50 percent from the field. Phoenix (9 - 22), on the other hand, sits near the bottom of the Western Conference for the second straight season. The Suns have won just three of their last eight contests. On Monday, Phoenix started the game off by accumulating a huge deficit, trailing 39 - 23 by the end of the first quarter. Point guard Eric Bledsoe, however, continued to impress, scoring 24 points to go with six rebounds and four assists. The Rockets will visit Dallas on Tuesday, while the Suns will travel to San Antonio on Wednesday.
