The Cleveland Cavaliers (33 - 12) took down the Detroit Pistons (25 - 22), 114 - 106, on Friday in the fourth game of the Tyronn Lue era. The conference - leading Cavs have had three big wins in a row after blowout losses to the Golden State Warriors and the Chicago Bulls. Big man Kevin Love proved to be a major factor once again for Cleveland, as he led the team with 29 points. All-Stars Kyrie Irving and LeBron James also saw significant contributions in the points column, posting 28 and 20 respectively. The Cavs ended up winning the game at the free - throw line, where they shot a whopping 27 for 29, and on the boards, where they held a 47 - 39 rebounding advantage and held league leader Andre Drummond to just eight. The loss snapped a brief two - game streak for the Pistons. The young team has seen a significant improvement over last season, in which they found themselves in the lottery yet again. Center Andre Drummond was named to his first All-Star team on Thursday, and led the team with 20 points against the Cavaliers. Drummond also recorded three blocks on the defensive end, despite an unusually low total on the boards. Shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also contributed significantly, dropping in 19 points on the night. Detroit will travel to Toronto on Saturday. Meanwhile, Cleveland will be playing host to the historic San Antonio Spurs.
