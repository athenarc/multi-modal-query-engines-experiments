The Hawks saw four brilliant performances from their starters, including clutch play from Paul Millsap, who made the difference in the victory for Atlanta. Millsap finished with 21 points, nine rebound, five assists, two steals and four blocks on 4 - of - 12 shooting, while Tim Hardaway Jr. stepped up again for the injured Thabo Sefolosha and is close to becoming a more permanent part of the starting lineup. Hardaway scored 25 points in 43 minutes, to go with seven rebounds, four assists and one steal. Damian Lillard was flexing his range from way beyond 24 - feet, while C.J. McCollum was clutch with needed baskets down the stretch. The duo combined for 47 points, but it took 45 shots, and outside of the strong shooting in the fourth quarter, Lillard ended up going 6 - of - 21 from the field. Maurice Harkless aided the guards in the front court with 17 points and nine rebounds.
