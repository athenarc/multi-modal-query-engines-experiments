The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the host Atlanta Hawks 135 - 130, at Philips Arena on Friday evening. The Cavs knocked down an NBA record 25 three - pointers on their way to victory, but came very close to letting it slip away, as the Hawks battled back from a 25 - point deficit, to bring it to a one - point game with 1:31 left. The Cavs were able to hang on largely thanks to a clutch three from none other than Kyle Korver, who made his first return to Atlanta since being traded. The Cavs (42 - 18) shot a blistering 54 percent from deep, as they hit 25 - of - 46 of their three - point attempts. Kyrie Irving and LeBron James both came up with stellar performances, combining for 81 points. Irving finished with a game - high 43 points, while James filled the stat sheet with 38 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. Channing Frye and Richard Jefferson were the only other players to score in double digits for Cleveland, finishing with 11 points each. The Cavs will look to build on the momentum from this win as they visit Miami on Saturday to face the second night of a back - to - back. Meanwhile, the Hawks (34 - 27) mounted an amazing rally to trim a 25 - point deficit with seven minutes left in the third quarter, to a one - point margin with 1:31 left in the game. Paul Millsap hit a couple clutch shots late in the fourth to bring the Hawks as close as they would come, and finished the game with 27 points and nine rebounds, in 37 minutes. Tim Hardaway Jr. was the high - point man for Atlanta, finishing with 36 points in 35 minutes off the bench. The Hawks remain fifth in the East but will need to get back to their winning ways, as they are only 4 - 6 in their last 10. They go on to play host to the Pacers on Sunday.
