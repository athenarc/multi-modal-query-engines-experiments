The Denver Nuggets (30 - 42) snatched victory from the jaws of defeat with a buzzer beater victory Wednesday against the Philadelphia 76ers (9 - 63) at Pepsi Center, 104 - 103. Philadelphia took a 98 - 97 lead on a Carl Landry hook shot with 3:22 to go in the game. They still owned that lead when Robert Covington stepped to the free throw line with 3 seconds to go and a one - point lead. But Covington made just one of the two free throws to give the Nuggets an opening. Lacking a time out, the Nuggets had to go the length of the floor, and Emmanuel Mudiay sank a three - point shot from near midcourt at the buzzer to give the Nuggets the comeback victory. Mudiay's buzzer beater finished off one of the best games of his career, as he scored 27 points (10 - 23 FG, 3 - 5 3PT, 4 - 5 FT), grabbed 11 rebounds, dished four assists and committed just one turnover. Gary Harris (6 - 11 FG, 5 - 5 FT) and Nikola Jokic (5 - 6 FG, 8 - 12 FT) added 18 points apiece. The Nuggets more than doubled Philadelphia's output from the free throw line, as they earned 40 free throws and sank 32 (80 percent). T.J. McConnell led the 76ers with 17 points (7 - 10 FG, 1 - 1 3PT, 2 - 2 FT) and dished five assists. Carl Landry (6 - 11 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and Robert Covington (6 - 15 FG, 3 - 10 3PT) scored 16 points apiece as the 76ers had five players reach double figures. Philadelphia shot an excellent 15 - 37 (41 percent) from three - point land, but just 39 percent on two - point shots, and they could n't capitalize on their deep sharpshooting as a result. The Nuggets head for Los Angeles to take on the Lakers on Friday night. Philadelphia's road trip continues with a Saturday matchup against the Trail Blazers.
