The Miami Heat defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 106 - 88, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Wednesday. These are two teams going in opposite directions and this result shows just which way they're both headed. It was a wire - to - wire win for Miami, as they led by double - digits for the majority of the game, after a 28 - 15 first quarter. The Heat dominated down low, as they won the rebounding differential, 48 - 34 and the points in the paint battle, 54 - 44. Free-throw shooting really killed Milwaukee, as they went just 16 - of - 28 from the charity stripe. The Heat (23 - 30) have now won 12 - straight games, as they continue to be the hottest team in the NBA. Hassan Whiteside was the player of the game, as he totaled 23 points and 16 rebounds on 10 - of - 12 shooting. James Johnson finished second on the team with 20 points, four rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocks off the bench. Goran Dragic accrued 16 points, four rebounds, seven assists and two steals. Wayne Ellington got the start for Dion Waiters (ankle) and scored 17 points on 6 - of - 11 shooting. The Bucks (22 - 29) have lost 11 of their last 13 games and a date with the Heat is the last thing they wanted to see. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the lone bright spot for Milwaukee, as he accumulated 22 points, eight rebounds and two steals. Jabari Parker was the only other starter in double figures, as he amassed 14 points and two assists. However, Parker went down with a knee injury and had to be carried off the court, so there are some major concerns over his availability moving forward. Michael Beasley led the bench in scoring, dropping 11 points in 12 minutes. Khris Middleton (hamstring) made his season debut and collected five points, two rebounds and two assists in 14 minutes of action.
