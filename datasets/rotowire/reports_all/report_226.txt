The Indiana Pacers (1 - 3) came away with their first victory of the season in Tuesday’s trip to the Palace of Auburn Hills, knocking off the previously undefeated Detroit Pistons (3 - 1), 94 - 82. The Pacers rode the strength of a 220 run in the second quarter to the win, which came after starting center Ian Mahinmi departed the game with a back injury. The frontcourt reserve trio of Jordan Hill, Myles Turner, and Lavoy Allen covered well for Mahinmi’s absence, combining for 20 points, 16 rebounds, and four blocks over 60 minutes. They weren’t the only contributors off the Indiana bench, which outscored its Detroit counterparts by a 43 - 2 margin. Backup guard Rodney Stuckey led the charge with 23 points against his former team. Paul George chipped in 16 points to go along with seven rebounds, five assists, and two steals. On the Detroit side, taking care of the ball proved to be a major issue. The Pistons finished with 23 turnovers against just 14 assists, with point guard Reggie Jackson (six turnovers) the most egregious offender. Andre Drummond also turned the ball over on four occasions, but more than made up for it with a super - size double - double of 25 points (12 - for - 17 shooting) and a career - high 29 rebounds. He’s now averaging a Chamberlain-esque 20 boards over the Pistons’ four games. Indiana will head back home for a matchup with the Boston Celtics on Wednesday, while Detroit gets a two - day break before heading out to Phoenix for a game Friday against the Suns.
