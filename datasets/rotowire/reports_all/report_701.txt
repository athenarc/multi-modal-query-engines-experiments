The Sacramento Kings (7 - 5) defeated the Chicago Bulls (8 - 4) 103 - 88 on Thursday. Sacramento had a four - game losing streak after their hot start, but they've won two of their last three games and have held their own against a murder's row of opponents lately. It's still relatively early in the season, but every time the Kings have stumbled, they've picked themselves up in the next game. DeMarcus Cousins (hip) and Rudy Gay (Achilles) played through their injuries Thursday. Cousins finished with 22 points and 14 rebounds in 34 minutes for a double - double. Gay put up 20 points and seven rebounds in 35 minutes. The Kings will embark on a four - game road trip Saturday that begins in Minneapolis against the Timberwolves. Chicago is in the midst of a seven - game road trip. Pau Gasol sat out a second straight game with a calf injury. Derrick Rose missed a third straight game with a hamstring injury. Jimmy Butler continues to pace the Bulls this season. He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 37 minutes Thursday. The Bulls will finish off their back - to - back set in Portland on Friday against the Trail Blazers. Gasol and Rose remain questionable for the game.
