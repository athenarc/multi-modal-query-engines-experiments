The New York Knicks (4 - 10) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0 - 13) 91 - 83 on Friday. New York was coming off of two straight losses, and with the winless Sixers looking for a win, this looked like it might turn into a tough game for the Knicks. Jose Calderon (calf) made his season debut and was slotted directly into the starting lineup. He finished with three points and three assists in 21 minutes. The Knicks will begin a three - game road trip in Houston on Monday against the Rockets. Philadelphia has lost 13 straight to begin the season, and while the struggling Knicks looked like a chance for the Sixers to finally secure their elusive first win of the season, the Knicks showed that they are n't quite as forlorn as the Sixers. Nerlens Noel had the best game of his rookie career Saturday. He put up 17 points and 12 rebounds in 39 minutes. The Sixers will return home to host the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday.
