The Philadelphia 76ers (16 - 52) defeated the Detroit Pistons (24 - 44) 94 - 83 on Wednesday in Philadelphia. The 76ers were able to pull off the win despite Nerlens Noel leaving the game with a right foot contusion after playing just 22 minutes. He had 11 points on 5 - of - 10 shooting, four rebounds and three blocks in that time and did not return. It was Ish Smith who led the way for Philadelphia, as he was moved into the starting point guard role while Isaiah Canaan was moved to the bench. Smith thrived in the role, recording 15 points on 6 - of - 12 shooting, eight assists and three steals in 26 minutes. Canaan struggled coming off the bench, putting up just nine points on 2 - of - 10 shooting and four assists in 22 minutes. Jason Richardson shot his way out of a slump, scoring 15 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting in 25 minutes, as it was just the first time in five games that Richardson scored in double figures. Conversely, Robert Covington struggled, as he shot just 1 - of - 6 from the field on his way to three points in 22 minutes off the bench. Thomas Robinson and Jerami Grant were able to make positive contributions in their reserve roles, scoring 12 and 10 points respectively. The win is just Philadelphia's third in 10 games, and they currently boast the third worst record in the NBA. It was a quick fall back to reality for the Pistons, as just a day after upsetting the Grizzlies and ending a 10 - game losing streak, they lost to one of the NBA's worst teams. They were without Greg Monroe, who sat out his second consecutive game with a strained knee. Despite the loss, Detroit did have some strong performances. Reggie Jackson followed up Tuesday night's big game with a triple - double, putting up 11 points on just 4 - of - 17 shooting, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in 32 minutes. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also followed up his 24 - point performance on Tuesday in a strong way, scoring 20 points on 7 - of - 16 shooting and grabbing eight rebounds in 36 minutes. Beyond those two, the Pistons struggled, as no other Detroit player scored in double figures. By losing 11 of their previous 12 games, they are destined for the NBA lottery. Up next, the 76ers will take on the Knicks at home Friday, while the Pistons head home Saturday to take on the Bulls.
