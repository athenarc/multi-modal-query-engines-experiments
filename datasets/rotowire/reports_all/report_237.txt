The Cleveland Cavaliers (25 - 20) continued their hot streak Sunday, beating the Oklahoma City Thunder (22 - 22) 108 - 98 at the Quicken Loans Arena. In a matchup between two of the league's biggest stars, LeBron James and Kevin Durant both put up huge games. James shouldered a bit more of the offensive load than usual, taking 25 shots from the floor to finish with 34 points. Durant countered with 32 points and nine assists. He landed awkwardly on a drive late in the fourth quarter, but was able to play through it for the rest of the game. Oklahoma City wrapped up its five game road trip Sunday with a 4 - 2 mark. Steven Adams, the team's usual starter, was dealing with migraines before tip off and did not play. Kendrick Perkins got the start at center and finished with four points and four rebounds before fouling out late in the fourth. The Thunder will return home Monday to host the Timberwolves. Cleveland has now won six in a row, with three of those wins coming against quality opponents. Kevin Love turned in a solid effort, finishing with 19 points and 13 rebounds to mark his 24th double - double this season. The Cavaliers will play the front end of a back - to - back Tuesday in Detroit before returning home to host the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.
