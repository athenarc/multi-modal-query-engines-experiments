The Sacramento Kings (13 - 17) defeated the New York Knicks (5 - 27) 135 - 129 in overtime on Saturday. Sacramento stopped their two - game losing streak with the win. DeMarcus Cousins sat out their loss to the Phoenix Suns on Friday with flu symptoms, but he was able to return Saturday and led the team with a game - high 39 points to go with 11 rebounds and four assists in 32 minutes. Rudy Gay and Darren Collison got in on the fun as well. Gay finished with 29 points, while Collison posted a double - double of 27 points and 10 assists. The Kings could n't be stopped on offense, shooting 55 percent from the field, 50 percent from beyond the arc and 88 percent from the foul line. Sacramento will try to keep the good times rolling when they embark on a four - game road trip that begins against the Brooklyn Nets on Monday. New York has lost seven straight games, and the immediate future looks bleak for them. Carmelo Anthony continues to play through knee soreness, putting up 36 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in 46 minutes, playing like a man in his prime. Amar'e Stoudemire sat out, resting for the third time in their last four games. Cole Aldrich and Jason Smith were the soup du jour in the frontcourt for the Knicks. Both performed adequately. New York has two more games on their Western Conference road trip. They'll take on the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday.
