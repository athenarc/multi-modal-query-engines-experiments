The Golden Warriors (20 - 2) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (17 - 8) 105 - 98 on Saturday. Golden State has won 15 straight games, and in their last two games, they've done it without starting center Andrew Bogut who has been sidelined with tendinitis in his knee. David Lee (hamstring) is nearing a return but has yet to be cleared to return to action, and even when Lee does return, there does n't seem to be more than a marginal role off off the bench available to him. Stephen Curry led the way with a game - high 29 points Saturday, and he was helped by Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, who both also finished with 20 - plus points. Golden State is playing a back - to - back set. They'll continue their road trip Sunday in New Orleans against the Pelicans. Bogut had fluid drained from his knee and will sit out Sunday. Dallas is playing through a relatively tough part of their schedule at the moment, and while they've been able to successfully dispatch middling teams, the Mavericks have n't been able to overcome most of the other title - contending teams they've faced, recently dropping games to the Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies. As a result they're just 2 - 3 over their last five games. Chandler Parsons suffered a back injury Tuesday but then played through the injury Wednesday. Even with two days off, he was rested Saturday, and Richard Jefferson was given the spot start at small forward in Parsons' absence. Jameer Nelson returned after a one - game absence with a shoulder injury. Nelson returned to the starting lineup and played 28 minutes. Dallas has two days off before going on the road to face the New York Knicks.
