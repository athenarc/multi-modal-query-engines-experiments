The Sacramento Kings (27 - 50) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (16 - 61) 116 - 111 on Tuesday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento. Despite both teams having already been eliminated from playoff contention, this still marked a hard fought game between these Western Conference rivals. The Kings came out as the superior shooters in this one, going 53 percent from the field and 38 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at 48 percent from the floor and just 32 percent from deep. Also helping push the Kings to a win was their rebounding, as they finished with a 49 - 36 advantage. With DeMarcus Cousins sidelined because of a foot injury, it was Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi who really stepped up and had huge games. Gay finished with 33 points (9 - 17 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 13 - 15 FT), seven rebounds and five assists, while Casspi posted 31 points (12 - 20 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt, 3 - 5 FT) and five rebounds. Casspi had far - and - away his best performance of the season, as he's really picked it up lately. Over his last four games, he's averaging 20 points, while shooting an impressive 57 percent from the field. Gay, on the other hand, is on fire as well, combining to go 19 - of - 35 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from deep for 57 points over his last two outings. He's now pushed his season averages to 21 points and 6 rebounds per game on the season. Coming off the bench, Derrick Williams had a strong showing as well. He went 8 - for - 12 from the field to score 18 points, while adding eight rebounds over 31 minutes as well. The 18 points matched a season - high for the forward, as it was one of his better outings of the year. Despite being unable to limit the Kings' offense, the Timberwolves nearly pulled off the victory due to some strong offensive performances of their own. Kevin Martin had the most impressive line, finishing with 37 points (13 - 31 FG, 3 - 11 3Pt, 8 - 11 FT) and eight assists. It was a season - high in field goal attempts for the guard, who had a slightly better performance than he did on Friday, where he went just 3 - of - 12 from the field. He's now averaging 20 points on the season and will continue to get off a ton of shots due to the vast amount of injuries the Timberwolves are dealing with. Rookie Andrew Wiggins had a big game as well though, recording 26 points (11 - 20 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT) and eight rebounds. He's posted 20 points or more in seven of his last eight games, as he's done his best to help Martin pick up the slack of those sitting out. Zach LaVine was the other big contributor. In 40 minutes, he finished with 21 points (9 - 18 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 4 FT) and 11 assists, marking just the second double - double of his career. The Kings' next game will be on the road against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Portland to take on the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.
