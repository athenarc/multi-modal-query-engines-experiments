The Phoenix Suns (15 - 46) lost for the15th time in their last 16 games Thursday, falling 108 - 92 to the host Miami Heat (35 - 26). Miami's backcourt of Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic combined for 52 points in the contest, dropping in 27 and 25 respectively. Wade also contributed seven assists in what was a resounding victory for the Miami squad. Despite the absence of power forward Chris Bosh, who has been sidelined with blood clots, Miami has held steadily onto fourth place in the Eastern Conference. Nights like Thursday certainly help, as Miami shot exquisitely from the field, posting 48 percent including 53 percent from deep. On Phoenix's side, meanwhile, rookie Devin Booker scored a career - high 34 points in 39 minutes. The 19 - year - old sharpshooter has made a big splash early on in his NBA career, capturing attention for his lights - out shooting and NBA-ready skill set. Despite being one of the youngest rookies, Booker is now just the second member of the 2015 draft class with multiple 30 - point games, joining first overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns. In the absence of injured stars Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight, the fresh - faced rookie has been handed the reigns to the offense, a role that he embraced with his team - high 21 shot attempts on Thursday. Booker proved himself as a knockdown shooter, hitting 11 of his shots including three three - pointers and also going 9 - for - 9 from the free - throw line. Another young rising star in Phoenix, third - year center Alex Len, played a team - high 40 minutes and recorded a double - double, dropping in 12 points and pulling down 13 rebounds. It was a resounding loss nonetheless for the Suns, who have quickly become the NBA's coldest team. With Bledsoe and Knight both inactive, Phoenix looks destined to add another high lottery pick to their already young group of players. The Suns will visit Orlando on Friday to face the Magic, while the Heat will travel to Philadelphia to take on the league - worst 76ers.
