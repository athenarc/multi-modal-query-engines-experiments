The Indiana Pacers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 91 - 70, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Sunday, The Clippers have been playing some dominant basketball this season, but this was a dud against a desperate Pacers team. Indiana stifled them with their defense, holding them to 70 points on 31 percent from the field and 17 percent from three - point range. The assist - to - turnover ratio was a huge factor as well, with Indiana recording 26 assists to just 14 turnovers and Los Angeles committing 20 turnovers to just 11 assists. Those numbers allowed the Pacers to take 22 more shots than the Clippers, making nearly twice as many shots.

Blake Griffin led the team in scoring, tallying 16 points and nine rebounds on 6 - of - 15 shooting. Chris Paul also struggled with his shot, totaling 13 points, four rebounds and four assists on 4 - of - 11 from the field. The only other player in double figures was Jamal Crawford, who scored 12 points off the bench. DeAndre Jordan grabbed 14 rebounds, adding eight points to his line.

Myles Turner was the player of the game, accruing 17 points and 12 rebounds in the win. Glenn Robinson III also scored 17 points, filling - in for George. Jeff Teague scored just seven points, but dished out 10 assists, Al Jefferson and Rodney Stuckey were nice sparks off the bench, accumulating 28 points and 13 rebounds between the two.
