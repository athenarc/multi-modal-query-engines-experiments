Rudy Gay and DeMarcus Cousins were the only two Kings averaging at least 10 points a game coming into Saturday's game and they were the only two starters for Sacramento to score at least 10 points in the win. In fact, this is the third straight game in which that has happened. Ricky Rubio tallied just five points and five assists in the loss and he has yet to reach double - digits in scoring, assisting or rebounding this season. Andrew Wiggins put up a rare line in this game, scoring 29 points and failing to record anything else but one rebound and one block. There was a 29 - point swing in this game, as the Timberwolves led by 19 in the first half, while the Kings took a 10 - point in the second half. These two teams will have a rematch in Minneapolis on Dec. 23 for their next meeting.
