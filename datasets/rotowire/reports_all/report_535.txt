Despite playing just 20 minutes in this game due to foul trouble, Juluis Randle fell one point shy of a double - double with his nine points and 10 rebounds. Thaddeus Young was the only starter in this game to shoot above 50 percent from the field, as he went 6 - for - 8 in a 14 - point, six - rebound performance.
