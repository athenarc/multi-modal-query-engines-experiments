In his Bulls debut Thursday, Dwyane Wade showed the NBA that an old dog can learn new tricks as he led Chicago to a win over the Celtics. After making just seven three - pointers last season, Wade hit four shots from beyond the arc in his Chicago homecoming. Wade's mark was the highest of any Bull, as the team hit 11 shots from three - point range in total. One of those shots came from another new face, point guard Rajon Rondo. Rondo is another player who many speculated would cause trouble for Chicago's floor spacing, but he got the job done along with his new backcourt partner. It was a good night for All-Star players, as Wade was n't the only star to score over 20. Jimmy Butler led the Bulls with 24, while Boston point guard Isaiah Thomas scored 25.
