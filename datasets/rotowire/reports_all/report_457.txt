The Raptors (14 - 9) squeezed out a 97 - 94 victory over the Spurs (18 - 5) at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday. The Raptors held a three - point lead into the final possession following a basket from Kawhi Leonard, but a huge offensive rebound by DeMar DeRozan after a Kyle Lowry miss helped give Toronto the win. The loss for San Antonio snapped a four - game win streak and Leonard, who was questionable to play due to an illness, finished with just nine points and seven rebounds. It was only a matter of time before the Spurs would crack and perhaps their downfall was due to no one truly stepping up and taking the reins. By the end of the game, 11 players had scored for San Antonio, but Manu Ginobili led the way with 17 points (5 - 11 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 8 FT) over 25 minutes off the bench. Tim Duncan returned to the lineup after getting the night off Monday against the 76ers, scoring eight points in 20 minutes. The Spurs really struggled from beyond the arc, finishing 7 - of - 26 to a tune of 27 percent in the game. DeRozan not only sealed the win with a big board, but had one of his best offensive performances of the season, scoring a game - high 28 points (10 - 15 FG, 8 - 8 FT) to go along with six assists and four rebounds in 37 minutes. He stuck to what has made him a successful scorer, taking high - percentage shots while working his way to the free throw line consistently. Playing with a short bench with DeMarre Carroll sidelined again, the Raptors got a big boost from Luis Scola, who finished with 16 points (8 - 14 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 0 - 1 FT) while pulling down eight rebounds over 33 minutes. The Raptors continue their six - game homestand Friday against the Bucks; the Spurs head back to San Antonio for a date with the Lakers.
