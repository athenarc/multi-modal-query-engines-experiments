The Portland Trail Blazers (48 - 25) clinched a playoff spot Tuesday with an emphatic 109 - 86 win over the Phoenix Suns (38 - 37) at the Moda Center. Portland will be going back to the playoffs after its second win over Phoenix in four days. While Friday's game was a tightly contested and low - scoring contest where Portland nabbed the 87 - 81 victory, Monday's game was out of hand by the eight minute mark of the third quarter. The Trail Blazers outscored the Suns 37 - 16 in the third to put the result beyond all doubt. Portland moves one game closer to clinching the Northwest Division while Phoenix's playoff chances may be coming to a close. Phoenix had a crucial four - game home stretch last week, but went 1 - 3 and stumbled again Monday. The Suns have now lost four games in a row and have a brutal schedule the rest of the way. All but one of Phoenix's final seven opponents are either in the playoffs or in contention for a playoff spot. Brandon Knight missed Monday's game after aggravating his pre - existing ankle injury during Sunday's loss to the Thunder. The Suns are now 5 games out of the eighth seed in the West with just seven games to go. Phoenix will return to action Thursday against Golden State. Portland has now won four straight games after a five - game skid earlier in March raised some concerns about its viability come playoff time. The Trail Blazers had the luxury of resting their starters for the fourth quarter, allowing seven of its eight reserves to log double - digit minutes. The Trail Blazers have a huge matchup with playoff implications on the horizon with a game against the Clippers on Wednesday. Portland needs to win to even the season series with Los Angeles at two games apiece.
