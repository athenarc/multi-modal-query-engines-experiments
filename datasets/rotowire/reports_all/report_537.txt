The Brooklyn Nets (1 - 1) defeated the Detroit Pistons (0 - 3) 102 - 90 on Saturday. Kevin Garnett must have known it was Daylight Savings Time, because he turned back the clock himself Saturday, putting up 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes. The Pistons sagged off of Garnett all night, and he made them pay with a barrage of mid - range jumpers. Joe Johnson did n't want to let Garnett get all the glory. Johnson abused the Pistons both inside the paint and beyond the arc, scoring a game - high 34 points to go with eight rebounds in 39 minutes. New coach Lionel Hollins is letting his verterans play this season, an idea that seemed out of the question for ex - coach Jason Kidd last season. Mirza Teletovic continues to be a great source of long - range shooting and rebounding off the bench for the Nets. He finished with 12 points and seven rebounds in 28 minutes. Andre Drummond was confined to 22 minutes due to foul trouble, but the return of Greg Monroe to the active lineup helped soften the blow of Drummond spending much of the game on the bench. Monroe was suspended for the first two games of the season, but in his regular season debut Saturday, he put up a double - double of 18 points and 11 rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Josh Smith each played over 40 minutes but had shooting woes throughout the game. Smith finished 2 - of - 8 from the free - throw line, while Caldwell-Pope missed all six of his heaves from beyond the arc. Brandon Jennings, who lost significant minutes to backup D.J. Augustin in the Pistons' first two games, was a revelation in the first half of the game and finished with 18 points and nine assists in 36 minutes. The Nets' next game is at home Monday against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Pistons have three days off before hosting the New York Knicks on Wednesday.
