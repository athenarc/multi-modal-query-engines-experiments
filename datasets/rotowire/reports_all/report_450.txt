The Washington Wizards defeated the Denver Nuggets, 123 - 113, Wednesday at Pepsi Center. The Wizards (39 - 24), who have now won three straight road games to improve their record away from home to 13 - 15, won Wednesday's matchup in fairly effortless fashion, as they opened up the game early and went into halftime with a 17 - point lead. That was thanks in large part to an incredibly hot shooting performance from Washington, as they shot 57 percent from the field and 42 percent from behind the arc. The Wizards were once again led by a pair of great performances from their starting backcourt, with John Wall posting a game - high 30 points and 10 assists, while Bradley Beal scored 23 points of his own. The two shot a combined 21 - of - 36 (58 percent) from the field. For the Nuggets (29 - 35), Wednesday's defeat marked their second loss in their last three games, and it was thanks in large part to their lack of defense, as Denver was pretty solid on the offensive side of the ball. As a team, the Nuggets shot 53 percent from the field and a scorching 46 percent from behind the arc, but the 123 points they gave up ended up being too much to overcome. Gary Harris led the way for Denver, shooting 10 - of - 15 from the field and 6 - of - 9 from behind the arc en route to scoring a game - high 26 points. Wilson Chandler added 21 points of his own, while Mason Plumlee added 19 points and 10 rebounds for a double - double. Up next, the Wizards will head to Sacramento on Friday to take on the Kings, while the Nuggets will head home Friday and play the Celtics.
