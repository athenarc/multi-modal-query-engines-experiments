The Boston Celtics (41 - 30) earned a home win against the Orlando Magic (29 - 41) Monday night at TD Garden, 107 - 96. Five Celtics finished in double figures and three went over 20 points as the Celtics offense largely had its way with the Orlando defense. Boston shot a robust 33 - 63 (52 percent) from inside the arc and shot 20 - 24 from the free throw line, good for a seven - point free throw advantage over the Magic. The Orlando offense, meanwhile, was stagnant, as they assisted on just 15 baskets and turned the ball over 11 times. Isaiah Thomas's 28 points led all scorers, and he added seven assists, five rebounds and a steal. Avery Bradley scored 22 points (9 - 15 FG) and added nine rebounds, and Kelly Olynyk scored 22 of his own in just 21 minutes off the bench behind a hugely efficient shooting night (7 - 12 FG, 4 - 6 3PT, 4 - 4 FT). Boston shot just 7 - 22 (32 percent) from the three - point line but was sharp enough in the rest of their offensive game to overcome the poor outside shooting. Victor Oladipo's 25 points led the Magic. The point guard shot 10 - 17 from the field and added a team - high eight rebounds and five steals. Evan Fournier, Aaron gordon and Andrew Nicholson were the only other Magic players to top double - digits, as they scored 13 points apiece. Orlando shot just 42 percent from the floor and a brutal 5 - 18 (28 percent) from three - point land, as they never were able to generate the offense to compete in this one. The Magic head to Detroit for a Wednesday matchup against the Pistons. The Celtics continue their homestand Wednesday against the Raptors.
