The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Boston Celtics 114 - 98 Monday at TD Garden. It was pretty much all Hawks (33 - 26) from start to finish, as Atlanta managed to end an ugly three - game skid with a big road victory. It was a complete team effort for the Hawks, as all five starters managed to score in double figures and combine for 82 of the team's 114 points. Dennis Schroder, who made his first start since the All-Star break, led the way for Atlanta with 21 points on 9 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with five assists and four rebounds in 30 minutes. The starting frontline of Dwight Howard and Paul Millsap each added a double - double, with Howard notching 17 points and 12 rebounds and Millsap adding 17 and 10. The victory comes after the Hawks dropped three games in a row by a total of 52 points. As for the Celtics (38 - 22), they've now officially hit a slump in what has been a successful season, losing three of their last four games. It was a poor shooting night from the whole team, as they combined to hit just 39 percent of their shots from the field and 29 percent of their three - pointers. Isaiah Thomas did lead the way for the Celtics with 19 points, although it came on a brutal 4 - of - 21 shooting from the field. Other than Thomas, Marcus Smart (16) and Jaylen Brown (15) were the only other players to reach double - digit scoring Monday. Up next, the Hawks will head home Wednesday to take on the Mavericks, while the Celtics will look to turn things around at home against the Cavaliers on Wednesday.
