Over the last five games, 76ers star Joel Embiid has been absent due to a knee contusion, and that opened the door for backup center and former No. 3 overall draft pick Jahlil Okafor to prove his worth to the organization - - or other organizations for that matter. Okafor has played in four of those five games, as he sat out for precautionary reasons in one, and in those four games, he's given mixed results. While offensively Okafor has been somewhat productive in averaging 14 points per game following his 16 - point performance Monday, he has n't done so at a very efficient rate. Okafor has failed to shoot over 50 percent in three of those four games, and considering how he does the majority of his work near the basket, shooting 46 percent overall in that stretch is not a very impressive mark.
