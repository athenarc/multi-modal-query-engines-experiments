The Atlanta Hawks (38 - 8) extended their winning streak to 17 games Wednesday against the Brooklyn Nets (18 - 27). With the tally resting at 113 - 102 in favor of the Hawks at the final horn, the Mike Budenholzer-coached squad marked a fifth consecutive margin of victory in double figures. Leading the way with 28 points and 15 rebounds, Paul Millsap tallied his second double - double in a three - game span. Joining Millsap in the double - double club were Al Horford (20 points and 10 boards) and Jeff Teague (13 points and 11 assists), the latter of which has dished out at least seven dimes in seven straight tilts. The NBA's top team in terms of three - point percentage also upheld their standard with 12 successful treys, including five more from the fingertips of Kyle Korver. Off the bench, Dennis Schroder logged two productive stretches of scoring en route to 13 points (5 - 8 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT). A tough test now awaits the Hawks, who take on the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday. The Nets received a three - day layoff due to Monday's blizzard postponement, but they could n't return to winning ways Wednesday. While they avoided losing by 35 - plus points for a third contest in a row, a 45 percent showing from the field and 9 - for - 24 shooting from beyond the arc were n't enough against the leaders of the Eastern Conference. Joe Johnson paced Brooklyn with 26 points in 37 minutes, while Jarrett Jack got back on track, recording 14 points and 13 assists. The starting five experienced a change prior to the opening tip, as Bojan Bogdanovic was swapped for Alan Anderson. Anderson proceeded to post 15 points and a season - high six assists, but other than Brook Lopez's 18 points and seven rebounds, the bench mob contributed a paltry 11 points and eight boards. Upon next taking the court Friday, the Nets will face another playoff worthy squad, the Toronto Raptors.
