The Cavaliers were the superior shooters in this game, going 52 percent from the field while the Jazz went just 42 percent from the floor. The Jazz turned the ball over 20 times, which also made a big difference Wednesday. The Cavaliers starters all reached double figures in points, as the bench really struggled to give them any help. As a whole, the bench contributed only 12 points, although the Cavaliers were still able to come out with the victory. LeBron James led all scorers in this one, nearing a triple - double with 26 points (8 - 16 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 10 - 14 FT), seven rebounds and nine assists. In the five games since he returned from his two week absence, he's averaged 31 points as he's been nearly unstoppable. Kevin Love also had a big game, recording a double - double with 19 points (7 - 15 FG, 1 - 7 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and 13 rebounds.

The Jazz received most of their production from Enes Kanter, who recorded a monster line of 24 points (9 - 20 FG, 6 - 8 FT) and 17 rebounds. He really struggled to get anything going over his last two outings, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Gordon Hayward reached double figures as well, finishing with 14 points (4 - 11 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and five rebounds. It was n't his best game of the season, as he was averaging 19 points per game coming into Wednesday. The Jazz did see some solid contribution off their bench though. Elijah Millsap recored 12 points (4 - 9 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), while Elliot Williams had an efficient 10 points (3 - 4 FG, 3 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT).
