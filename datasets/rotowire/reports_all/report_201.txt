The Phoenix Suns (27 - 20) defeated the Washington Wizards (31 - 16) 106 - 98 on Wednesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix. Coming out of the third quarter, the Suns had a nice 80 - 66 lead. The Wizards made a run in the fourth though, out - scoring the Suns 32 - 26, but the comeback fell short as Phoenix finished with an eight - point victory. While the Suns were out - rebounded 50 - 41, they shot better than the Wizards, going 46 percent from the field, while the Wizards went 42 percent from the floor. Goran Dragic was the leader for the Suns in this game, posting a game - high of 20 points (8 - 15 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 4 FT), to go along with two assists and two steals. He had a poor shooting performance (3 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt) in Sunday's game against the Clippers, so it was good to see him find his shot and have some success. The Suns also had a nice contribution from their bench, as Isaiah Thomas had 18 points (4 - 13 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt, 6 - 7 FT) and four assists in only 20 minutes. He's been playing his best basketball of the season offensively, averaging 23 points over his last five games. Brandan Wright also had an efficient night from the bench with 13 points (6 - 7 FG, 1 - 1 FT) and five rebounds in only 17 minutes. Coming close to a double - double, Markieff Morris had 16 points (7 - 17 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), seven rebounds and four assists. He's averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the season. Leading the Wizards in points was center Marcin Gortat, who went 6 - for - 12 from the field to score 14 points, while also adding eight rebounds. It's a very rare occurence for Gortat to lead this team in scoring, so it was clear John Wall and Bradley Beal did n't have their best games offensively. Wall recorded 11 points (5 - 16 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt), seven rebounds and seven assists, while Beal had 13 points (5 - 15 FG, 3 - 3 3Pt) and one rebound. Wall had just put in three solid games in a row, so it was a surprise to see his shot not falling. Getting the start at power forward, Kris Humphries recorded a double - double with 11 points (4 - 8 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and 15 rebounds. It was his second double - double in his last three games. Otto Porter was the high scorer off the bench with 14 points (5 - 8 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) in 23 minutes. The Suns' next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday, while the Wizards will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Saturday.
