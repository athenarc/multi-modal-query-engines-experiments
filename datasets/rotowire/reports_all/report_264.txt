The Nuggets were locked in from the start as they out - scored the Hornets 57 - 40 in the first half. The Hornets battled back from a 22 - point third quarter deficit to make it a five - point game with four minutes to go, but Denver did not falter, thanks in large part to D.J. Augustin's 14 - point fourth quarter. Seven players scored in double digits for the Nuggets as a solid team effort led to an impressive road victory for the young squad. D.J. Augustin was automatic as he tallied a game - high 24 points on very good shooting (8 - 11 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 5 - 7 FT), along with three assists, one rebound and one steal, in 23 minutes off the bench.

The Nuggets did a good job rebounding and also shot 50 percent from deep, en route to their 13th win on the road. Charlotte managed to put together a huge run late in the game to get within striking distance but could not finish the job as the Nuggets remained relentless. Cody Zeller tallied a career - high five blocked shots, along with 10 points and two rebounds in 29 minutes. Nicolas Batum led the Hornets in scoring, with 24 points (9 - 18 FG, 5 - 10 3Pt. 1 - 2 FT), along with nine assists, eight rebounds, one steal and one block, in 40 minutes., while Kemba Walker added 15 points, seven rebounds, five assists and two steals, in 36 minutes.
