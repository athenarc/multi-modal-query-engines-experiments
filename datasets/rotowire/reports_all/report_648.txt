Goran Dragic was sensational in the Heat's two - point win Monday over the Timberwolves, and with that effort, it looks as if the point guard is returning to the form of the All-NBA player he was back in 2014. Dragic scored a team - high 33 points and dished out nine assists in 35 minutes against Minnesota, but what was most impressive was his shooting performance, as the Yugoslavian hit 7 - of - 9 shots from behind the arc and 13 - of - 17 shots from the field overall. And this is starting to become a more regular occurrence for Dragic, as following Monday's performance, he has now shot at least 55 percent from the field in five of his last six contests, and he is shooting 60 percent from the field and an absurd 75 percent from three - point range. But on top of all the scoring, Dragic has remained a playmaker, dishing out 8 assists per game over that same stretch.
