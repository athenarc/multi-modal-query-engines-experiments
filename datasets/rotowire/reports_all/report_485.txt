The Minnesota Timberwolves (7 - 32) defeated the Denver Nuggets (18 - 22) 113 - 105 on Saturday at the Pepsi Center. Denver had won its previous two meetings against Minnesota entering Saturday's contest. Both teams were playing the second halves of back - to - back sets Saturday, but this game was not lacking in excitement as the outcome up in the air until the final minute. Mo Williams was clutch down the stretch, hitting two jumpers to extend Minnesota's lead to seven with just over 30 seconds to go. Minnesota improved to 2 - 1 on its current four - game road swing thanks to a big performance from Andrew Wiggins. The rookie ended up with 31 points and nine rebounds on the night. On the injury front, Nikola Pekovic and Kevin Martin are nearing returns from injury, but did not suit up on Saturday. Minnesota will travel to Charlotte to take on the Hornets on Monday. Denver had a chance to further solidify itself among the teams in the race for the eighth seed in the West, but was unable to capitalize against a Minnesota club that had just six wins coming into Saturday. Randy Foye returned to action after missing 26 games with a torn quad. He played just eight minutes and did not score a point. Recently acquired Jameer Nelson had a productive night, scoring 16 points in 19 minutes. The Nuggets have a tough stretch ahead, beginning with the Warriors on Monday.
