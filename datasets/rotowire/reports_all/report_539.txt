The Atlanta Hakws (41 - 29) comfortably defeated the Houston Rockets (35 - 35) on Saturday, 109 - 97. Both teams have regressed heavily since making their respective conference finals in 2014 - 15. Atlanta, a 60 - win team last season, is left jockying for position between third and sixth in the Eastern Conference. The win against Houston leaves them in third, half a game ahead of their rival Miami Heat. All-Star center Al Horford led the way for the team with 22 points, while also tallying nine rebounds and a pair of blocks. Young role player Tim Hardaway Jr. also contributed heavily, posting 20 points off the bench. The team shot an impressive 50 percent on the night. Houston, meanwhile, struggled from the field, shooting just 39 percent. The team also had issues with turnovers, coughing the ball up 17 times in total. A big positive, however, for Houston was recent bench acquisition Michael Beasley. The former second overall pick and reigning Chinese Basketball Association MVP dropped 30 points and pulled nine rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench. Houston will visit OKC on Tuesday, while Atlanta will host Washington on Monday.
