Julius Randle may not be as much of a highlight reel as compared to the rest of the Los Angeles Lakers, but the Kentucky product is quietly taking his stats up a notch. Although it's a small sample size of just seven games, Randle has improved across almost every statistical category from his 2015 - 2016 season where he played 81 games. The Lakers forward is averaging 14 points, 8 rebounds and 3 assists per game while shooting 60 percent overall. Randle continued the strong start with 18 points on 6 - of - 9 shooting against the Phoenix Suns in the win on Sunday. The minutes management for the deep Lakers squad could be the reasoning behind the shared success among the first seven games. Randle saw 28 minutes of action Sunday, while Dâ€™Angelo Russell (28 minutes) and Nick Young (36 minutes) saw slightly more than the third - year forward. As for the bench, Brandon Ingram, Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson all saw more than 25 minutes of action.
