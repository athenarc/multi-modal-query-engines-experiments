The Milwaukee Bucks (25 - 35) defeated the visiting Houston Rockets (29 - 31) 128 - 121, on Monday night at BMO Harris Bradley Center. The Rockets have been slouching lately as they barley hang on to the eight spot in the West. That trend continued Monday night as they trailed 32 - 26 after one quarter for the 10th straight game. Despite winning the last six match - ups versus Milwaukee, Houston came up short this time as the Bucks racked up a season - high 128 points behind huge nights from Jabari Parker, Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo. This win snaps a two - game losing streak for the Bucks, while the Rockets fall to 2 - 6 in their last eight games. Jabari Parker led the Bucks in scoring with a career - high 36 points on 16 - 25 shooting from the field, along with five assists, four rebounds and two steals, in 40 minutes. Khris Middleton added a cool 30 points, in part thanks to perfect 15 - 15 shooting from the free throw line, while Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded the second triple - double of his career, with 18 points, 17 rebounds and 11 assists, along with four steals and two blocked shots, in 42 minutes. Milwaukee recorded 30 assists and shot a blistering 59 percent from the field and 53 percent from deep. Michael Carter-Williams was a late scratch with a sore knee, while Jared Bayless returned after missing games, to contribute 18 points, in 35 minutes off the bench. The Rockets starters accounted for 99 of their points, with the bench chipping in only 22. Although 121 points is usually enough to win an NBA game, Houston failed to record one blocked shot, allowing the Bucks to cruise to a season - high 128 points. Dwight Howard had a huge game with 30 points and 13 rebounds, in 35 minutes, while James Harden tagged along with 26 points, nine assists, six rebounds and three steals, in 40 minutes. Trevor Ariza also filled the stat line, with 20 points, 11 assists, eight rebounds and two steals, in 35 minutes. Donatas Motiejunas was quiet in his second game back, with six points, five rebounds and two assists, in 19 minutes off the bench. Next, the Rockets will host the Pelicans on Wednesday, before heading out on a five - game, eastern road trip. The Bucks will look to gain ground in the East as they host the Pacers on Wednesday.
