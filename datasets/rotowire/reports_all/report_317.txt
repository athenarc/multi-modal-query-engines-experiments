The Charlotte Hornets (10 - 19) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (14 - 15) 108 - 101 on Tuesday. Charlotte has won four straight games, and while the wins have come during an easy part of their schedule (Sixers, Jazz, Nuggets, Bucks), the talking heads have tried to fit the narrative of Lance Stephenson (groin) sitting out as the reason for the Hornets' success. Stephenson has missed the last four games, coinciding with the Hornets' resurgence, and while they have no doubt played remarkably better of late, putting all the blame on one player is misleading. Kemba Walker led with the way Tuesday, putting up a team - high 27 points in 36 minutes. Charlotte will go on the road to face the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday. Milwaukee has dropped two straight and three of their last four games as they struggle to try and fill the hole of Jabari Parker (knee) being out for the rest of the season. Brandon Knight tried his best to keep the Bucks in a position to win, putting up a game - high 34 points in 34 minutes. Ersan Ilyasova (concussion) returned from nine - game absence, putting up four points and four rebounds in 16 minutes off the bench. Despite dropping a few games recently, the Bucks have stayed competitive every night. They'll go on the road to face the Atlanta Hawks on Friday.
