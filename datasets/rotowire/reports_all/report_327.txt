The Boston Celtics took care of the New Orleans Pelicans 111 - 93 on Monday night. The game was tied at 25 - 25 after the first quarter, but it was never close after that. The difference in the game was as simple as shooting, as the Celtics shot 50 percent from the field, while the Pelicans shot just 41 percent. New Orleans came into this game with more talent and the Celtics came in with better teamwork and it's clear that the teamwork prevailed here. The New Orleans starters really killed this team as they were outscored by the Celtics starter 70 - 27 in the loss. Boston continues to surprise fans with their efficient play. They won this game in relatively easy fashion thanks to a great team effort. Isaiah Thomas once again led the team with 22 points and five assists. Jared Sullinger did grab a season - high 20 rebounds in the win and that's a great sign after his recent struggles. Kelly Olynyk also had a good game off the bench, as he tallied 22 points, three rebounds, three assists, two blocks and two steals in the victory. Boston will have a much better test when they host the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday in their next game. Anthony Davis scored 16 points, but aside from that, the rest of the starting - five was a nightmare on Monday. The other four starters combined for just 11 points and had a terrible plus - minus. Ryan Anderson had another nice game off the bench though, as he collected 18 points and nine rebounds in the loss. This is yet another 110 - plus points allowed and that's been the issue all season long, as they rank dead - last in points allowed this season. New Orleans will have a few days off to think about this terrible performance, when they host the Washington Wizards on Friday in their next scheduled game.
