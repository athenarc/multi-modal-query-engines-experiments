The Washington Wizards (45 - 33) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (18 - 61) 119 - 90 on Wednesday in Philadelphia. The Wizards were without All-Star point guard John Wall (rest), but they still no issue dealing with the 76ers. Ramon Sessions was great in replacing Wall in the starting lineup, posting 19 points (5 - 7 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 7 - 9 FT), seven assists and four rebounds in 29 minutes. Bradley Beal led the team in scoring with an efficient 21 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT) in 23 minutes, while Marcin Gortat also put up a nice stat line of 19 points (8 - 9 FG), seven rebounds and six assists in 26 minutes. Paul Pierce was the only other starter to score in double figures with 10 points in 22 minutes, while Kevin Seraphin (12) and Will Bynum (10) each scored in double figures off the bench. Washington shot a very impressive 65 percent from the field and 53 percent from three, and the victory moves them just one game behind both the Bulls and Raptors as they look to make a late push for third place in the Eastern Conference. Robert Covington had a great shooting night and led the way for the 76ers in the losing effort, posting 27 points (8 - 11 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) in just 24 minutes and was the only Philadelphia starter to reach double figures on the night. Jason Richardson also had an efficient performance, scoring 17 points (6 - 7 FG, 4 - 5 3Pt) in 21 minutes off the bench. Thomas Robinson scored 11 points and was the only other 76er to score in double figures, but he also added 12 rebounds to give himself a double - double on the night. The team shot a woeful 35 percent from the field, but the loss does help Philadelphia in their quest for the No. 1 overall pick, as they continue to boast the third worst record in the league. Up next, the Wizards will travel to Brooklyn Friday to play the Nets, while the 76ers will head to Chicago and go up against the Bulls on Saturday.
