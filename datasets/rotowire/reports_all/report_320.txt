The Toronto Raptors (51 - 24) extended their franchise record for wins in a season with a 99 - 95 victory Friday against the host Memphis Grizzlies (41 - 35). The Raptors continue to build themselves as a viable contender, remaining within striking distance of the Cleveland Cavaliers for control of the Eastern Conference. The All-Star backcourt of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan has played no small part, of course, as the duo's members remain the top two scorers on the team. This held true on Friday, as DeRozan led the team and the game with 27 points, complemented by Lowry's 22. Center Jonas Valanciunas, meanwhile, came up big with 14 rebounds and a whopping seven blocked shots. All in all, it was a solid yet narrow win for the Raptors, who have built momentum heading into the postseason. Memphis, meanwhile, is quickly falling in the standings after what has now been a five - game skid. The absence of star center Marc Gasol has been a difference - maker, and will potentially put the Grizzlie's fifth spot in the West in jeopardy. Memphis shot just 41 percent from the field on Friday, a significantly lower mark than their opponents were held to. Veteran big Zach Randolph offered up 16 points, but did so on just 6 - for - 18 shooting. Things look bleak for Memphis as the team remains riddled with injuries going forward. The Raptors will face one of the toughest matchups in the association on Saturday as they face the Spurs in San Antonio. The Grizzlies, meanwhile, will host the Orlando Magic on Sunday.
