The Portland Trail Blazers (2 - 2) handed the Minnesota Timberwolves (2 - 1) their first loss Monday, winning 106 - 101 at the Target Center. After jumping out to a commanding 13 - point lead in the first quarter, the T-Wolves failed to keep Damian Lillard at bay. Portland's point guard poured in a season - high 34 points (14 - 25 FG, 4 - 9 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT) with seven assists in 38 minutes. Minnesota nearly completed the rally from behind in the fourth quarter, but costly turnovers and missed free throws led to the T-Wolves' demise. The new - look Blazers are really missing the presence of LaMarcus Aldridge down low, as they have n't been able to find consistent play in their frontcourt so far this season. Meyers Leonard and Mason Plumlee combined for just 13 points and 11 rebounds in 52 minutes. Portland has been forced to rely heavily on its guard play from Lillard and C.J. McCollum, who has provided the perfect complement at the two - guard spot. McCollum finished with 18 points, six rebounds, and four assists in 36 minutes. Rookie Karl-Anthony Towns has started off his NBA career on the right foot, but took a small step back against Portland on Monday. He had a quiet night offensively, scoring just 11 points on 5 - of - 9 shooting from the field and pulled down only five rebounds in 27 minutes. Towns was in foul trouble all night, but did however manage to block four shots and did an excellent job keeping the Blazers frontcourt in check. Ricky Rubio came just short of a triple - double with 12 points, nine assists, and nine rebounds in 32 minutes, while Andrew Wiggins had another off night shooting the basketball with 16 points on 5 - of - 17 from the field. The Blazers play the first game of a back - to - back Wednesday at Utah. Minnesota welcomes the Heat to town Thursday.
