Milwaukee's stifling defense held the Bulls to a season - low scoring total, while also limiting them to a 30 percent success rate from the field. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way with a 22 - point, 11 - assist double - double, while Jabari Parker managed 12 points. John Henson and Tony Snell posted a pair of 10 - point efforts, and Greg Monroe came off the bench to tally a 14 - point, 12 - rebound double - double over 23 minutes. A nightmarish outing for the Bulls saw Dwyane Wade pace them in scoring with a modest 12 points, while Taj Gibson and Robin Lopez posted a pair of eight - point tallies on a combined 7 - of - 20 shooting. Jimmy Butler and Rajon Rondo had matching seven - point contributions. Bobby Portis actually served as the second - leading scorer on the team despite coming off the bench, posting 10 points and eight rebounds in 19 minutes.
