The Toronto Raptors (45 - 21) took care of the Milwaukee Bucks (29 - 39) in a 107 - 89 victory on Tuesday. This appeared to be a lopsided matchup on paper and the Raptors took it to the Bucks. It was the second and third quarters that made a difference, as Toronto outscored Milwaukee 59 to 38 in that stretch. The rebounding was a huge difference, with the Raptors bringing down 48 rebounds to the Bucks 37. The three - point shooting was a factor as well, with Milwaukee shooting 15 percent, while Toronto shot over 48 percent. The Raptors played this game without DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas and didnâ€™t miss a beat. Kyle Lowry stepped up in their absences, as he accumulated 25 points, 11 assists and four rebounds in just 28 minutes of action. Bismack Biyombo filled - in admirably for Valanciunas as he double - doubled in a 12 - point, 13 - rebound outing. On deck for the Raptors is a matchup against the Indiana Pacers on Thursday. This loss snapped a three - game winning streak for Milwaukee. Jabari Parker and Giannis Antetokounmpo both tied the team - lead with 19 points, with no other player scoring more than 12. Antetokounmpo actually flirted with a triple - double yet again, as he tallied 18 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists in the defeat. The Bucks will look to play better on Thursday against the shorthanded Memphis Grizzlies in their next game.
