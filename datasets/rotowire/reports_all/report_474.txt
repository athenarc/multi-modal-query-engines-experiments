The Phoenix Suns (16 - 46) finally earned a win against the Orlando Magic (27 - 34) on Friday, winning 102 - 84. Third year center Alex Len led the way for the Suns, who have had a major slide and now hold the third - worst record in the NBA. Len posted 31 points and 15 rebounds in one of his strongest outings of 2015 - 16. Rookie Devin Booker, meanwhile, followed up a 34 - point outing on Thursday with 14 points, four rebounds, and six assists. The 19 - year - old has established himself as a premier rookie and an elite three - point shooter already, early in his stint in the NBA. The Suns earned their win in emphatic fashion, holding the Magic to just 35 percent from the field and out - rebounding the Magic 57 - 50. The Magic, meanwhile, remain firmly out of the playoff picture, particularly after losing to the NBA's coldest team. Sophomore Elfrid Payton led the team with 19 points while dishing 11 dimes. The rising star has been hot and cold lately, but continually shows flashes of star potential. Another prospect, rookie Mario Hezonja followed up a career - high on Wednesday with an efficient 12 points and four rebounds on Friday. The Croatian teenager was selected with the fifth pick in the 2015 draft. The Suns will travel to Memphis on Sunday, while the Magic will take on the league - best Warriors in Oakland on Monday.
