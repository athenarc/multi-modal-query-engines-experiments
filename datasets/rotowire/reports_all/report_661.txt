Nevertheless, the Hawks responded, as Jeff Teague scored six of Atlanta’s next eight points and they were able to pull away in the end.

His partner in the frontcourt, Al Horford, recorded a double - double of his own, finishing with 21 points and 13 points in 35 minutes. Kyler Korver (11) was the only other Hawk in double figures.
