The Utah Jazz (9 - 9) defeated the Indiana Pacers (12 - 7) 122 - 119 on Saturday. The Pacers trailed by 17 points in the 3rd quarter, but a red hot Paul George sparked a sharpshooting comeback in the final period. George finished the night with a career high 48 points on 15 - of - 27 shooting, to go along with eight rebounds and three assists. The No. 10 overall pick from the 2010 draft added eight 3 - pointers in the effort, and matched up against Gordon Hayward, who was taken ninth overall in that same draft, which made for a competitive one - on - one battle throughout the evening. Rodney Stuckey finished second in scoring for the Pacers, contributing 23 points off the bench, including a clutch jump shot with just over a minute remaining in regulation to extend the Pacers lead by three. Jordan Hill and George Hill added 10 points each, while starters Ian Mahinmi and Monta Ellis finished with six points a piece. While Paul George could not be contained, the Jazz answered with Derrick Favors, who contributed 35 points and 13 rebounds, including the game tying layup with 10 seconds left in the 4th quarter. Favors extended the momentum into the overtime period by making his way to the free throw line and playing a physical game underneath the rim. The Jazz were without Rudy Gobert (knee) and missed out on his defensive efficiency, specifically in the blocks category. Gordon Hayward finished with 22 points, five rebounds and five assists on 5 - of - 14 shooting. Trey Burke is becoming more confident in his jump shot, evidenced by his eight buckets in 33 minutes off the bench, as he finished with 19 points and seven assists. Raul Neto may find himself on the highlight reel after making a ridiculous circus shot, after contact, in the first half and contributed 13 points in 18 minutes. Both teams play on Tuesday, with the Pacers returning home to face the undefeated Golden State Warriors (210), while the Jazz visit the Sacramento Kings (7 - 14).
