Despite 50 points from Portland's Damian Lillard, the Toronto Raptors (41 - 19) beat the visiting Trail Blazers (33 - 30) on Friday, 117 - 115. Toronto is on pace for the first 50 - win season in the franchise's history, and currently the team sits at second in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors faced a tough challenge on Friday against one of the NBA's hottest teams, but came away with the victory nontheless. The Raptors backcourt combined for 66 points, with DeMar DeRozan leading the team with 38. DeRozan went a ludicrous 24 for 25 from the free - throw line, seemingly drawing every foul en route to the team's victory. The Blazers also came into the contest equipped with a dynamic backcourt duo, Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. The two combined for 74 points on Friday, with 50 coming from point guard Damian Lillard. Lillard, who has been playing on another level since being snubbed from the NBA All-Star game, went 16 - for - 28 from the field and 12 - for - 13 from the free - throw line. Lillard and McCollum were the only Blazers, however, to crack double - digit scoring in Toronto, a stat that has been all too familiar for Portland in their meteoric rise to playoff contention. The Blazers won the first three games of their road trip but have faltered as they hit the Atlantic Division, with back - to - back losses now coming to Boston and Toronto. The Blazers will travel to Detroit on Sunday, while Toronto will host Houston.
