The Celtics were expected to win this game easily, but the Knicks had other ideas. The rebounding differential was glaring to say the least, with New York winning that battle, 58 - 33. The bench production was a huge part of that, with New York's bench grabbing 33 rebounds, while Boston's bench snatched down just eight boards. New York shot over 50 percent from the field, while Boston could n't crack 39 percent. Derrick Rose was at MVP form, as he accumulated 30 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks in the win. Willy Hernangonez was huge off the bench, providing 17 points and 11 rebounds. Mindaugas Kuzminskas also scored 17, with Carmelo Anthony and Justin Holiday scoring 13 a piece. Isaiah Thomas carried the load for Boston, collecting 39 points, three rebounds and two assists. Al Horford did provide five points, seven rebounds and 10 assists, but went just 2 - of - 14 from the field.
