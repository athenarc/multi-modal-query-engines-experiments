The New York Knicks (8 - 6) beat the Houston Rockets (5 - 9) 107 - 102 on Saturday. Coming into the 2015 - 2016 NBA season, Kristaps Porzingis was looked at as a major work in progress, but the result of the No. 4 overall pick has given the Knicks fans something to really cheer for. Porzingis finished the night with 24 points, 14 rebounds and seven block on 8 - of - 12 shooting, including two 3 - pointers and a perfect 6 - of - 6 from the free throw line. Arron Afflalo has made a meaningful impact in his return to the starting lineup over the past few games, helping out from the 3 - point line as well, as he drained four 3 - pointers from deep in the effort. Carmelo Anthony was efficient in his 24 minutes played, scoring 14 points on 5 - of - 10 from the field, including a layup with 0:39 left in the 4th quarter which extended the Knicks lead by three. Six Houston Rocketsâ€™ finished in double figures, but it was not enough to win in front of their hometown crowd. James Harden led the way for Houston, finishing with 24 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists on 8 - for - 20 shooting. Harden, who finished second overall in the MVP voting last season, is struggling with efficiency from the floor, shooting 38 percent overall. Trevor Ariza, Terrence Jones, Clint Capela, Jason Terry and Marcus Thornton rounded out the rest of the Rockets in double figures, but the all around effort was not enough to secure a win. Houston recently fired head coach Kevin McHale with interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff. The Rockets defensive efficiency ranks in the lower third of the league, and letting up 107 points to the Knicks will not help that cause going forward. Houston will look to bounce back against the Memphis Grizzlies (7 - 7) at home on Wednesday, while the Knicks visit the Miami Heat (8 - 4) on Monday.
