The host Utah Jazz defeated the New York Knicks on Wednesday, 108 - 101. Utah (44 - 28) earned a much - needed win thanks in large part to the play of center Rudy Gobert. Gobert scored a new career high with 35 points on a mind - boggling 13 - of - 14 from the field. Gobert, one of the front - runners for the Defensive Player of the Year award, also blocked four shots and pulled down 13 rebounds. The ridiculous efficiency the Jazz got out of Gobert lifted the team's shooting percentage to a respectable 46 percent despite cold nights from a number of other players. This included a 6 - of - 17 shooting night from All-Star forward Gordon Hayward. Another area in which the Jazz excelled was turnovers. The team coughed the ball up just seven times on the night. New York (27 - 44) has struggled mightily of late and looks poised to finish in the lottery yet again as the season comes to an end. Knicks fans did see hope for the future exhibited on Wednesday, as sophomore big man Kristaps Porzingis had an excellent outing. Porzingis led the team with 24 points and also pulled down seven rebounds. However, the Knicks still fell short and walked away with their eighth loss in their last 11 games. The Jazz will visit the Clippers on Saturday, while the Knicks will see Portland on Thursday.
