The Atlanta Hawks (59 - 19) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (35 - 42) 114 - 111 on Wednesday in Brooklyn. After a big fourth quarter from the Nets, the two teams went down to the wire, changing leads three times in the last two minutes before an Al Horford dunk and two free throws from Jeff Teague sealed the deal for Atlanta. Horford led the way for the Hawks, posting 24 points (11 - 20 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt), seven rebounds and four assists in 33 minutes of play. Teague recorded a double - double in the winning effort of 15 points (4 - 11 FG, 7 - 11 FT), 12 assists, six rebounds and four steals in 33 minutes as well. DeMarre Carroll was the other Atlanta starter to score in double figures, finishing with 19 points (7 - 13 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt), nine rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes. Mike Scott was also huge for the Hawks off the bench, scoring 20 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and grabbing eight rebounds in 31 minutes. Paul Millsap was out once again with a shoulder injury, while Mike Muscala got the start in his place, but he had just nine points (4 - 6 FG) in 24 minutes. The win brings Atlanta just one game away from 60 wins on the year with just four games remaining in the regular season. They have already locked up the number one seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs. Brook Lopez, as he has grown a habit of doing, led the way for Brooklyn, scoring 26 points (8 - 17 FG, 10 - 10 FT) and grabbing 10 rebounds in 39 minutes. Over his last two games now, Lopez has put up 58 points and 19 rebounds. Joe Johnson was not too far behind Lopez, scoring 21 points (9 - 15 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt) and grabbing eight rebounds, but he missed the potential game - tying three at the end of regulation. Deron Williams also continues to play well, posting a double - double of 10 points and 13 assists, while Thaddeus Young also recorded a double - double of 15 points and 11 rebounds. Jarrett Jack (14) and Bojan Bogdanovic (12) round out the six Nets' players who scored in double figures. The Nets were hot coming into Wednesday's matchup as winners of seven of their last eight, and while they are still winners of seven of their last nine, both those losses came at the hands of the Hawks. Regardless, the Nets still find themselves in the playoffs and hold a one - game lead over the Pacers and Heat for the final spot in the East. Up next, the Hawks will head home Friday to take on the Hornets, while the Nets will stay home Friday and play the Wizards.
