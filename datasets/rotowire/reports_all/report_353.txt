The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Indiana Pacers, 100 - 88, Monday at Spectrum Center. The Hornets (27 - 35) won their second straight game in convincing fashion after opening up an 11 - point lead by the end of the first quarter and never letting go of the lead. Kemba Walker lead the way with yet another great all - around performance, scoring a game - high 28 points on 10 - of - 22 shooting from the field to go along with seven assists and six rebounds in 35 minutes. Nicolas Batum was n't too far behind, scoring 21 points in 43 minutes. In the end, however, it was Charlotte's defensive effort that guided them to victory, as the team tallied up 10 steals and forced the opposition into 15 total turnovers. Their opposition, the Pacers (32 - 30), struggled mightily offensively outside of their star Paul George, who finished with a game - high 36 points on 15 - of - 25 shooting from the field, 10 rebounds and five assists in 36 minutes. Unfortunately for Indiana, those 36 points were nearly half of the team's total points, and his teammates were ice cold from the field. Outside of George, the Pacers shot 22 - of - 56 (39 percent) from the field, and their inability to support their start ultimately cost them Monday's game. Up next, the Hornets will travel to Miami on Wednesday to take on the surging Heat, while the Pacers will look to bounce back Wednesday against the Pistons.
