DeMarcus Cousins exploded for a massive 36 - point, 20 - rebound double - double that also included four assists, two steals and a block, but it was n't enough to overcome a similarly impressive 31 - point outing from Bradley Beal that included 12 - of - 24 and 4 - of - 7 tallies from the field and three - point range, respectively. John Wall registered a 19 - point, 11 - assist double - double while also hauling in eight rebounds, but he committed a game - high 11 turnovers. Otto Porter and Marcin Gortat combined for 25 points and 15 rebounds, while Kelly Oubre, Jr. led the bench with a 10 - point, 10 - rebound double - double. Rudy Gay was next behind Cousins with 18 points but the rest of the starting five fell short on the stat sheet, as Darren Collison, Arron Afflalo and Kosta Koufos combining for just 13 points. Ty Lawson led the bench with a 12 - point effort.
