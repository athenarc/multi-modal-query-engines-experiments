The Dallas Mavericks (41 - 24) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (16 - 46) 100 - 93 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Coming out of the third quarter, the Lakers surprisingly held a 77 - 75 lead. The Mavericks picked it up in the fourth quarter though, out - scoring the Lakers 25 - 16 to end the game and seal the seven - point victory on the road in Los Angeles. The Mavericks were the superior shooters in this one, going 49 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three - point line, while the Lakers finished at 46 percent from the field and just 14 percent from deep. The Lakers also turned the ball over 16 times, while forcing the Mavericks into just eight. Monta Ellis did the bulk of the work offensively for the Mavericks. He went 12 - for - 22 from the field and 5 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 31 points, while adding three assists in 38 minutes. He had a brutal showing against the Golden State Warriors on Friday, where he shot just 14 percent (2 - for - 14 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt) from the field, so it was good to see him get back on track Sunday. Dirk Nowitzki finished with 12 points (5 - 12 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt) and four rebounds in 26 minutes. He has n't been scoring much lately, as he's averaging just 13 points over his last four games, which is far less than his season average of 17 points per game. Also scoring less than his season scoring average was Chandler Parsons, who recorded just 11 points (5 - 11 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 0 - 1 FT) and six rebounds. Like Nowitzki, he's been playing poorly offensively of late and is averaging just 10 points over his last four games. Despite their performances though, they were still able to come out with the win and end their two - game losing streak. Rookie Jordan Clarkson had a solid game in the losing effort, finishing with 15 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), six rebounds and five assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's coming off a 25 - point, six - assist performance Friday. Over those two games, he's shot a combined 18 - for - 31 from the field, as he looks to be dialed in and more confident than he's been all season long. Also doing his best to help the Lakers stay in the game was Carlos Boozer, who came off the bench for a team - high of 17 points (8 - 15 FG, 1 - 1 FT), to go along with eight rebounds in 25 minutes. Over his last four games, he's averaging 13 points and 8 rebounds as he continues to be the veteran leader of this team. Wesley Johnson shot well, going 6 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 15 points. He's combined for 29 points and nine rebounds over his last two games. Wayne Ellington chipped in with 13 points (6 - 16 FG, 1 - 7 3Pt) and five rebounds as well. The Mavericks' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday.
