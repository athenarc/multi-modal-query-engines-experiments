Dion Waiters had an surprisingly hot start to the regular season in his first year with the Heat, as he became one of the primary scoring options on a struggling Miami team, but a groin injury in late November derailed the former Syracuse star and left him sidelined for a little over a month. Following his return on Jan. 4, Waiters found the floor inconsistently as he worked his way back into basketball shape. But now, eight games later, Waiters' efficiency and production has been out of this world. Following his 33 - point heroic performance against the Warriors on Monday, Waiters has now, in each of his last two games, scored 33 points in 33 minutes, and he has done so at a ridiculous efficiency. In those two performances, Waiters has shot 25 - of - 39 (64 percent) from the field and 11 - of - 16 (69 percent) from behind the arc. Miami, as winners of four straight, is hot, and Waiters is the biggest reason why.
