While pairing Anthony Davis with fellow frontcourt superstar DeMarcus Cousins at the trade deadline has n't necessarily led to a surplus of wins, Davis' production has not faltered. In fact, since Cousins joined the team, Davis' overall production has increased. Even with Cousins' return to the floor Wednesday after missing two straight games with an ankle sprain, Davis still managed to put up a game - high 30 points on 11 - of - 21 shooting and 13 rebounds in 36 minutes. Now, since the All-Star break when the team traded for Cousins, Davis is averaging 29 points on 52 percent shooting from the field and 12 rebounds over 36 minutes per game. Before the All-Star break, when Davis had the frontcourt to himself, Davis was averaging 28 points on 50 percent shooting and 12 rebounds over 36 minutes per game.
