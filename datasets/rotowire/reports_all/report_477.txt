The Utah Jazz (10 - 10) dismantled the New York Knicks (10 - 13) to the tune of a 106 - 85 scoreline on Wednesday. The Jazz took care of this game early and never allowed the Knicks to fight their way back in it. In fact, Utah was up 49 - 18 in the first 15 minutes and took a 25 - point lead into the half. Utah shot over 50 percent from the field in the first half and amazingly did not commit a turnover until 28 minutes into the game. The Jazz held the Knicks to under 40 percent shooting in the win as well. The Jazz have been playing horrible defense since Rudy Gobert got injured, but they were great here. They held the Knicks starters to just 31 points in the win and allowed just 11 points in the opening quarter. Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors carried the load once again. Hayward tallied 24 points, four rebounds and five assists in the victory. Favors recorded 20 points and eight boards to fall just shy of his fourth - straight double - double. Utah had allowed an average over 110 points per game without Gobert in the lineup, so this defensive performance is a great sign going forward. The Jazz have a much tougher test in their next game, when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday. The Knicks were stifled in this game and really didnâ€™t muster up anything until it was too late. No player scored more than 12 points and that's simply a bad recipe to win a game. Carmelo Anthony led the team with 12 points and five rebounds. Phenom rookie Kristaps Porzingis had one of his worst games of his short career, as he could only provide four points and three rebounds on 2 - for - 8 shooting. This is just one of those game for the Knicks and they can just chalk it up to playing in a tough environment against a stifling defense. They'll look to bounce - back when they take on the Sacramento Kings on Thursday in the second half of a back - to - back set
