The New Orleans Pelicans (18 - 28) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (12 - 35) 105 - 103 on Saturday thanks to Jrue Holiday's late - second game - winner. This game had an exciting finish with both teams giving blows all the way down to the final whistle. Holiday hit a three - pointer with 10 seconds left to take a three - point lead, but Joe Johnson followed that with a game - tying three with six seconds left for the Nets. On the Pelicans' next possession, Holiday fumbled the ball before regaining possession and hitting a wild fade away for the winning margin with one second left. The bench scoring was the big difference for New Orleans, as they got 55 bench points to the Nets 24. Brooklyn did a great job of hanging around in this game, but just couldn’t prevail late. Brook Lopez carried the Nets, as he tallied 33 points, 10 rebounds, three steals and four blocks in the loss. Thaddeus Young also had a nice game, as he amassed 16 points, eight rebounds and four assists in the defeat. This gave them their 13th loss in their last 15 games and it doesn’t get much easier against the Detroit Pistons on Monday in their next game. This gives New Orleans seven wins in their last nine games and the “must - win” homestand is really helping this team back into the playoff hunt. Anthony Davis missed the last two games with a concussion, but played big here. While Davis started 0 - for - 9 from the field in the first half, he still finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds in 40 minutes of action. Holiday was great down the stretch, as he finished with 26 points and seven assists. Ryan Anderson also continued his recent hot stretch, as he accumulated 24 points, six rebounds and five assists in the win. Up next for New Orleans is the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday.
