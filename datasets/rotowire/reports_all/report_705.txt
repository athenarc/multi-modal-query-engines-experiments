The Portland Trail Blazers (26 - 7) defeated the Toronto Raptors (24 - 8) 102 - 97 on Tuesday at the Moda Center in Portland. At the end of the third quarter the Raptors had established a 70 - 63 lead, but the Blazers were able to come back and out - score the Raptors by seven, pushing the game to overtime. In overtime the Blazers were able to take control and finish off the victory in front of their home fans. Portland shot 33 percent from the three - point line, while Toronto shot only 18 percent, so that may have been the difference in this one. With LaMarcus Aldridge returning from an illness, he and Damian Lillard re - established their offensive duo. Lillard finished with 26 points (9 - 24 FG, 4 - 15 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT) and nine assists, nearly recording a double - double. Aldridge on the other hand shot really well, going 10 - for - 19 from the field to record 23 points, while also adding 13 rebounds. Despite missing games, he picked up right where he left off and scored at least 23 points for the sixth straight game. Wes Matthews continued to stay hot with his shot. He went 7 - for - 14 from the field and 5 - for - 10 from beyond the arc to score 19 points, while also adding six rebounds. Nicolas Batum and Chris Kaman were the other Blazers to reach double figures with 13 and 10 points respectively. With DeMar DeRozan sidelined, Kyle Lowry continued to pick up the slack. He finished the game with 25 points (10 - 26 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), seven rebounds and five assists, doing a little bit of everything for this team. Over his last three games, he's now averaging a ridiculous 29 points as the clear offensive leader. James Johnson, who's filling in for DeRozan, had a decent game as well. He scored an efficient 14 points (7 - 11 FG) and grabbed 11 rebounds, giving him his first double - double of the season. Greivis Vasquez was the biggest contributor off the bench. He went for 13 points and three rebounds. Jonas Valanciunas and Terrence Ross had 14 and 12 points apiece. The Blazers' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday, while the Raptors will travel to Oakland to play the Golden State Warriors on Friday.
