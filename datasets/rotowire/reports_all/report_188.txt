The Atlanta Hawks (4 - 3) completed a fourth quarter comeback to beat the Utah Jazz (3 - 6) 100 - 97 on Wednesday night at Philips Arena. The Jazz found themselves up by six heading into the fourth quarter, but things did n't quite go as planned. Utah scored only nine points in the fourth, and were out - scored 18 - 9 to lose by three when all was said and done. Utah was led by a strong all - around showing in terms of scoring, as six players scored in double figures. Despite the scoring balance, it still just was n't enough. Alec Burks lead the way with 22 points (9 - 15 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), to go along with three assists, two rebounds and one steal. Trey Burke posted a double - double for the Jazz, with 11 points (5 - 15 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt) and 11 assists. It was his first double - double of the year. The Jazz have now dropped two straight, and will head to New York to take on the Knicks Friday. The Hawks have to be happy to walk away with the win after scoring just 18 points in the fourth quarter. They did the job on the defensive end though, which allowed them to get over the .500 mark on the year. This was Atlanta's third win in a row, and they got a monster game from Paul Millsap, who had 30 points (13 - 23 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt), along with 17 rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Kyle Korver also posted a double - double, with 17 points (5 - 10 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) and 10 rebounds. He also chipped in six assists in 38 minutes. Atlanta will now get a night off before taking on the Miami Heat at home on Friday.
