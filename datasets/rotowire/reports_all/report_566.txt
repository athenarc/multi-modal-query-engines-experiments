These were two teams headed in opposite directions, but the Timberwolves steadied the ship with a historic game from Andrew Wiggins on Sunday. The former No.1 overall pick dropped a career - high 47 points, which is 11 points above his previous high. Nemanja Bjelica was the secret weapon though, as he got his first start of the season and set season - highs with 24 points, eight rebounds and three steals. The bench is the only reason Los Angeles hung around, as they outscored their starters 52 - 47 and the Timberwolves bench 52 - 20. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams continue to be one of the better backcourt tandems off the bench in the league, as they combined for 31 points, eight rebounds and five assists in this defeat. Timofey Mozgov had a game to forget, as he fouled out in 14 minutes while trying to guard Karl-Anthony Towns.
