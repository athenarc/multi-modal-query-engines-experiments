The visiting Washington Wizards took down the host New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday, 107 - 94. Washington (27 - 20) has now won eight of its last nine games. On Sunday, the convincing win was due in large part to strong play from All-Star point guard John Wall. Wall recorded 18 points and 19 assists while at the helm of the strong Wizards offense. Washington was able to stave off a comeback attempt from New Orleans early in the second half with a strong fourth quarter. All five Wizards starters scored in double figures, and the starting five accounted for 96 of Washington's points. The team finished shooting over 50 percent from the field with ten three - pointers. New Orleans (19 - 29) has had a bumpy season thus far, trading off wins and losses fairly consistently after a rough 1 - 9 start. On Sunday, the Pelicans were the Anthony Davis show, as the superstar led the team with 36 points and 17 rebounds. Three steals and two blocks rounded out what was a typically monstrous night for the 23 - year - old big man. Bench struggles were a problem for the Pelicans on Sunday, as the second unit shot only 36 percent on the night. Overall, the Pels' 45 percent shooting was not enough to overcome a very strong night for the Wizards on the offensive end. The Pelicans will visit Toronto on Tuesday, while Washington will host the Knicks on Monday.
