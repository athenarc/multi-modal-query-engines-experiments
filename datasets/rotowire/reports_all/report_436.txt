The Dallas Mavericks (27 - 22) took down the struggling Brooklyn Nets (12 - 35) on Friday, 91 - 79. The Mavericks have remained solidly in the Western Conference playoff picture despite losing multiple starters to free agency this offseason. Dallas has been boosted by small forward Chandler Parsons' return from injury. Parsons led the team with 19 points against Brooklyn while also pulling down 10 rebounds. Georgian center Zaza Pachulia, whose campaign for the NBA All-Star game nearly landed him a starting nod, also notched a double - double, recording 16 points and 12 rebounds. The Nets hold the third - worst record in the NBA, and do not hold their own draft pick next year (Boston received Brooklyn's unprotected 2016 pick as part of a previous trade). Despite these negatives, the team has seen bright play from Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young in the frontcourt. Lopez led the game with 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, while Young posted an 11 - point, 10 - rebound double - double while grabbing five steals. Brooklyn will travel to New Orleans on Saturday to take on the Pelicans. Meanwhile, Dallas will play host to Phoenix on Sunday.
