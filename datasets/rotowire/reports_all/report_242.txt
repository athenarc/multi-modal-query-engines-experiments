The Raptors used a second - half rally to avoid an upset, defeating the Pacers 106 - 99 in the season opener Wednesday night in Toronto. After trailing by as many as 16 points in the second quarter, the Raptors outscored the Pacers 35 - 23 in the third. Indiana fought back to tie the game 93 - 93 late in the fourth, but clutch shooting by DeMar DeRozan helped Toronto seal the game. DeRozan finished with a game - high 25 points with six assists and five rebounds. Pacers all - star forward Paul George started the game off slow, but looked like his old self in the second half. He nearly recorded a triple - double with 17 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists over 37 minutes. Indiana's big offseason acquisition, Monta Ellis, did n't make his presence felt in his Pacers debut. The sharpshooter went 3 - 11 from the field and 0 - 1 from distance, finishing with just nine points and six assists in the loss. The lone bright spot was the three - point shooting of George Hill and C.J. Miles, who combined for 9 - of - 15 shooting from beyond the arc. DeMarre Carroll signed a four - year contract with the Raptors this offseason to provide energy - - and he did just that Wednesday - - scoring 14 points with eight rebounds and four assists while playing shutdown defense for 41 minutes. Center Jonas Valenciunas started off the season with a big double - double with 21 points on 8 - of - 11 shooting and 15 rebounds. The Raptors showed a lot of resilience, hanging on for the victory despite shooting 69 percent from the charity stripe. The Pacers will head home and host the Grizzlies on Thursday, while the Raptors will head to Boston for a showdown with the Celtics on Friday.
