The Boston Celtics (32 - 40) beat the New York Knicks (14 - 59) 96 - 92 on Friday. Mini-Manimal Jae Crowder was at it again on Friday. He came off the bench and scored 17 points to go along with nine rebounds in 29 minutes of ferocious energy. He's averaged 15 points, 7 rebounds and 1 steals over his past five games. Crowder has also been doing a nice job of attacking the basket and getting to the free throw line. Over his last two games he's got to the charity stripe 19 times and sank 15 of those attempts. His improved play has been a key cog in the Celtics establishing themselves as a playoff contender. It also did n't hurt to have Isaiah Thomas back and looking like his old self again. Thomas had 18 points and six assists in just his second game back from injury. He had an under whelming performance in his return to the lineup on Wednesday against Miami, scoring just four points on seven shots in 20 minutes. The 12 million dollar man Andrea Bargnani had a nice overall game against the Celtics. He finished with 25 points, seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks. The 25 points tied a season high, the third time he's done that this season. He almost led the Knicks to their first victory since they inexplicably beat the San Antonio Spurs back on Mar. 17, they've lost six straight since that game. The Chicago Bulls will host the Knicks on Saturday. The Celtics next tilt is against former coach Doc Rivers and the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday.
