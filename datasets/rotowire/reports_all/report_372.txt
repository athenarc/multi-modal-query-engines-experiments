The Miami Heat (8 - 4) held off the Philadelphia 76ers (0 - 14) to win 96 - 91 on Saturday. This was the Sixers best chance at a win all season, but they couldn’t quite hold off the Heat. Miami ended the game on a 20 - 4 run and held the Sixers to one basket over the final seven - plus minutes. Not to mention, that one basket was a meaningless one with just seconds left in the game. The Heat held the Sixers to 38 percent shooting and blocked 14 shots in the win. Philadelphia's bench was a bright spot though, as they outscored Miami's bench 47 to 26. This was a rough loss in a disastrous season for Philadelphia. They had a big lead early, but simply couldn’t hold on. They did get two great bench performances, as Robert Covington dropped 21 points while Isiah Caanan dropped 22 points. Philadelphia's best player on this night was rookie Jahlil Okafor, who tallied 16 points, 11 rebounds and three steals en route to a double - double. The rookie now leads the team in scoring and is second on the team in rebounding. They might have their best chance at a win when they take on the equally - young Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday. The Heat looked horrible in the first half, but leaned on their stifling defense to pull out a big win. Miami got an outstanding performance from Dwyane Wade, who tallied 27 points, seven rebounds, four assists and three steals in the victory. Hassan Whiteside also had a great game, as he collected 13 points, nine rebounds and eight blocks in the win. Those eight blocks add to his already league - leading total and he's truly playing at a different level this season than years past. This is one of the best defenses in the NBA right now and they showed why on Saturday. Miami will look to keep up their strong defense against the surging New York Knicks on Monday.
