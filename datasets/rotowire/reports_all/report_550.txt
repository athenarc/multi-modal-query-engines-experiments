The Dallas Mavericks (15 - 12) beat the Memphis Grizzlies (14 - 14) 97 - 88 thanks to some stifling second - half defense on Friday. These are two teams that are going in opposite directions right now and this result proves that fact. Dallas outplayed Memphis in nearly every facet, as they outshot, outrebounded and outassisted the Grizzlies. They held Memphis to just 39 points in the second half and 37 percent shooting throughout the game. Memphis has had one of the worst offenses in the NBA this season and that certainly didnâ€™t improve on Friday. They had just 13 assists and made only 30 baskets in a dreadful game. Since moving Zach Randolph to the bench, things have only gotten worse in Memphis and more moves may be on the horizon. Mike Conley led the team with 20 points scored and Marc Gasol put in a 16 - point, eight - rebound effort. The Grizzlies will look to play better on Saturday, when they host the Indiana Pacers. The Mavericks had a spark about them tonight and showed Memphis how tides are changing in the West. There were some fun moments, as Dirk Nowitzki turned back the clock to dunk and record a block in this game. The team recorded an amazing 27 assists on 34 made baskets and that emphasizes how good their ball movement was tonight. Zaza Pachulia had yet another double - double, as he snatched 10 points and 18 rebounds in the win. The most encouraging sign here was the effort by Chandler Parsons, who accumulated 16 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in 31 minutes of play. Dallas will have a few days off until they play the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday in their next fixture.
