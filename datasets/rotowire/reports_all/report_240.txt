The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 121 - 116, in overtime at Smoothie King Center on Saturday. As usual, Anthony Davis spearheaded the victory for the Pelicans (4 - 10), but Jrue Holiday and Langston Galloway both provided key offensive support off the bench. Davis scored eight of the Pelicans' 13 points in overtime, while the latter two combined for 45 points on 16 - of - 31 shooting.

Michael Kidd-Gilchrist turned in a 10 - point, 13 - rebound double - double that also included a pair of assists, two blocks and a steal. Marco Belinelli led the bench with a season - high 22 points, along with 10 rebounds and five assists. His scoring haul included an outstanding 7 - of - 9 tally from beyond the arc.
