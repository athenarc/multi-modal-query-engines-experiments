The Spurs were led by Tiago Splitter, who finished with 14 points (5 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and four rebounds in just under 22 minutes. He's only reached double figures in points six other times this season, so it was good to see him have a productive outing. Danny Green had a solid showing, going 5 - for - 7 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 13 points, while adding six rebounds. He's been very productive for the Spurs over his last three games, averaging 17 points over that span. Coming one rebound shy of a double - double, Kawhi Leonard posted 12 points (4 - 11 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt) and nine rebounds. After returning from an injury on Friday that had kept him out of the lineup for a month, Leonard recorded 20 points, so he came back down to earth a little bit in this matchup. Both Tony Parker and Tim Duncan played limited minutes, scoring four (2 - 5 FG) and 12 points (3 - 8 FG, 5 - 6 FT) respectively. Also coming off the bench, Aron Baynes added a double - double with 12 points and 11 rebounds. The Jazz just could n't get in a rhythm offensively against the Spurs, as only two players reached double figures in points. Coming off the bench, Rudy Gobert led the team in, scoring 13 points and grabbing an impressive 18 rebounds in 28 minutes. The 18 points were a new season - high for him, while the double - double was his sixth on the season. Gordon Hayward really struggled with his shot, going only 4 - for - 15 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 10 points. After scoring 31 points on Friday, he was n't able to have a repeat performance and scored well under his season average of 19 points per game. While he came one point shy of reaching double figures in points, Derrick Favors added nine points (4 - 11 FG, 1 - 2 FT), 13 rebounds and four blocked shots. This game was the first time in seven matchups that he did n't have at least 15 points.
