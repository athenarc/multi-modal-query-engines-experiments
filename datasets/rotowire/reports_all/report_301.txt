The Milwaukee Bucks (9 - 13) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (9 - 13) Monday 90 - 88 at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee. The game was an absolute thriller, as with the Bucks down one and the shot clock turned off, the team needed to foul. However, they got one better, as Michael Carter-Williams forced a jump ball with C.J. McCollum. Carter-Williams won the jump and performed a beautiful pick and roll with Greg Monroe, with Monroe scoring the game - winning basket. Monroe led the way all night for Milwaukee, finishing with 16 points and 12 rebounds in 27 minutes. Gianni Antetokounmpo was close behind Monroe, scoring 17 points and grabbing nine rebounds in 31 minutes. However, no player was as important down the stretch as O.J. Mayo - who started the game at point guard - as he scored 11 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter and hit big shot after big shot, including a three - pointer with 16 seconds that brought the team within one. For the Trail Blazers, it was Damian Lillard who led the way in the losing effort, recording a game - high 23 points, seven assists and five rebounds in 38 minutes. C.J. McCollum, despite a poor shooting night, was the only other Portland started to score in double figures, scoring 17 points and recording five steals in 36 minutes. The other three starters combined to score just 18 points. Up next, the Bucks will stay home Wednesday to take on the Clippers, while the Trail Blazers will head to Cleveland Tuesday to take on the Cavaliers.
