The Boston Celtics dominated the visiting New York Knicks, 115 - 87, on Friday night at TD Garden. It was a physical game right from the start, which worked out in favor of Boston, as Carmelo Anthony was ejected from the game in the second quarter for arguing a foul call after a tussle between him and Amir Johnson. Isaiah Thomas was huge for Boston (4 - 4) as he led the way offensively with 29 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting, in only 28 minutes. Thomas went 3 - of - 5 from deep, while the Celtics were great from downtown overall, hitting 11 - of - 27. They shot only 39 percent from the field overall but made up for it with vicious defense, forcing 25 turnovers from the Knicks. Kelly Olynyk was solid in his second game back, with 19 points on 6 - of - 11 shooting, seven rebounds and three assists, in 30 minutes. Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart both filled the stat sheet. Smart finished with 12 points, 10 assists, six rebounds and three steals, while Bradley notched 15 points, 10 rebounds, two assists and four steals. The Celtics move to 3 - 1 at home and will head out for a two - game road trip beginning in Indiana on Saturday. With this loss the Knicks (3 - 5) fall to 1 - 3 on the road and have not achieved consecutive wins once yet this season. They were coming off a good win in Brooklyn but failed to carry that momentum into this one, which may have had something to do with the fact that Carmelo Anthony was ejected mid - second quarter. Anthony scored 12 points in 12 minutes before losing his temper. Kristaps Porzingis was the high - point man with 14 points, along with six rebounds and two blocks, in 23 minutes. Derrick Rose added 11 points, six assists and four rebounds, while the only other player to tally double - digits for the Knicks was Justin Holiday, with 10. The Knicks can only look ahead, where they have to bring their best effort to Toronto for their second game in as many nights Saturday.
