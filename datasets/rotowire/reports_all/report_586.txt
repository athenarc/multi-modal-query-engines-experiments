The Toronto Raptors (46 - 21) took down the Indiana Pacers (36 - 32) in overtime on Thursday, winning 101 - 94. Center Bismack Biyombo recorded a career - high and franchise - record 25 rebounds to lead the team to victory. Needless to say, Toronto was merciless on the glass, outrebounding Indiana 57 - 48. While Biyombo was the game's biggest story, shattering his personal rebounding record while also scoring 16 points on just six field goal attempts and recording a pair of blocks, All-Star Kyle Lowry also had a big night. Lowry scored 28 points and neared a triple - double, also recording eight rebounds and eight assists. Fellow All-Star guard DeMar DeRozan matched Lowry's scoring while getting to the free - throw line 12 times. All in all it was a big night for the Raptors, who were able to walk away victorious despite an abysmal 36 percent shooting night. The team has surpassed all expectations, rivaling the Cleveland Cavaliers for the top of the Eastern Conference headed down the stretch. After Thursday's win, Toronto sits just two games out of the number one spot. The Pacers, meanwhile, had an equally horrific shooting night, going just 39 percent from the field. Star Paul George led the way with 18 points and nine rebounds, but no one Pacer took over the game in the way Biyombo and the Raptors backcourt were able to. Guard Monta Ellis came up with four big steals and dished out seven assists, but shot just 3 - for - 11 on the night. The loss puts Indiana more firmly in the seventh slot in the Eastern Conference, and Thursday's matchup looks as though it may be a playoff preview if seeding remains constant for the rest of the season. Toronto will host the ailing Boston Celtics on Friday, while Indiana will see the powerhouse Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday.
