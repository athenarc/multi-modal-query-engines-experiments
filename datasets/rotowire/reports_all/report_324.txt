The Miami Heat (32 - 24) defeated the Indiana Pacers (30 - 26) in a potential playoff preview matchup Monday at American Airlines Arena, 101 - 93 in overtime. Dwyane Wade sunk a pair of free throws with four seconds left to give Indiana an 88 - 87 lead, but he fouled Monta Ellis on the other end with less than a second remaining to give the Pacers a chance to end it in overtime. Ellis missed the first, however, and the game went to overtime. The Heat sunk the first three field goals of overtime and never trailed in the extra period as they pulled out the victory. Goran Dragic led the Heat with 24 points (10 - 17 FG) and added eight rebounds and five assists. Hassan Whiteside played 41 minutes off the bench and scored 19 points, grabbed 18 rebounds and blocked six shots. Justice Winslow filled up the box score as he earned big minutes in overtime, as he scored 15 points, grabbed seven rebounds, dished four assists and swiped four steals. The Heat pulled off the victory despite awful shooting, as they mustered just 38 - 100 from the floor and 2 - 13 from three - pont land (15 percent). Paul George led all scorers with 31 points (11 - 24 FG, 4 - 7 3PT) and added 11 rebounds, four assists and three steals. Myles Turner scored 16 points and added five rebounds and two blocks, but fouled out in overtime. Ian Mahinmi was the only other Pacers starter in double figures, as he scored 11 points on 3 - 5 shooting. The Pacers missed nine free throws, including Ellis's critical last - second front - end miss, and shot just 64 percent (16 - 25) from the line. The Pacers return home to host the Knicks on Wednesday. The Heat continue their homestand Wednesday against Golden State.
