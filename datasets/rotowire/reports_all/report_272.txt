In a battle between a veteran team and a young team, the more veteran core escaped with a victory. Jimmy Butler continues his fantastic run, as he tallied 40 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the win. Nikola Mirotic started for the rested Dwyane Wade and finished with 15 points and 15 rebounds. The key for Chicago was the rebounding, as they snatched down 56 rebounds, while holding Los Angeles to just 37 on their end. The Bulls also shot 52 percent from the field, while holding the Lakers to 44 percent. Lou Williams and Larry Nance Jr. were the leading scorers for the Lakers, as they combined for 43 points off the bench. The bench was n't all good though, as Jordan Clarkson went 1 - of - 12 in a forgettable game. The five Los Angeles starters combined for just 51 points, while the Bulls got 89 points from their five starters.
