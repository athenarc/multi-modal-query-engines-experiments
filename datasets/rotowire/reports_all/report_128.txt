The Los Angeles Clippers (7 - 4) defeated the Miami Heat (6 - 6) 110 - 93 on Thursday. Los Angeles was sputtering a little to start the season after coming in with high expectations in their second season under president and coach Doc Rivers, but they've won two games in a row to put them three games over .500, and though the Clippers have lost games to some of the Western Conference's other title contenders, they have gotten the job done against the bottom - feeder and mid - tier teams they should beat. Chris Paul led the way with a double - double of 26 points and 12 assists in 33 minutesm Thusday. The Clippers will play the Grizzlies in Memphis on Sunday for the third game of a seven - game road trip. Miami has dropped four of their last five games. Injuries can be blamed for most of their woes. Dwyane Wade missed four of those games with a hamstring issue, including being out Thursday. Josh McRoberts missed three games with a painful blister on his foot but returned Thursday. Luol Deng returned to action after sitting Monday's game with a wrist injury. Norris Cole left the game with a dislocated left middle finger and did not return. Shabazz Napier enjoyed a career night, putting up 17 points, five rebounds, and three assists in 32 minutes off the bench. The Heat will travel to Orlando to play the Magic on Saturday.
