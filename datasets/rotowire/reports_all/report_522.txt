The Sacramento Kings (27 - 42) picked up a road win Sunday night over the New York Knicks (28 - 43) at Madison Square Garden, 88 - 80. The Knicks' only lead of the game came at 4 - 2, as the Kings immediately rattled off a 19 - 4 run to open up a 21 - 8 lead. The Knicks managed the close the lead to three points at halftime, and the Kings never led by double - digits in the second half, but the early lead they built up was enough to hold off New York's anemic offense, which was clearly feeling the loss of Carmelo Anthony, who was out with migraines. DeMarcus Cousins scored a game - high 24 points (11 - 23 FG) and grabbed a game - high 20 rebounds (five offensive) to lead the Kings, his second 20 - 20 game of the season (2/19 against Denver). Rudy Gay added 17 points (8 - 21 FG) and Omri Casspi scored 15 points (5 - 9 FG) off the bench. The Kings shot just 28 percent from three (7 - 25) and 40 percent from the floor, but they committed just 11 turnovers as they played just clean enough to earn the victory. Robin Lopez's 23 points led the Knicks, and he matched Cousins's 20 rebounds in his first 20 - 20 game of the season. Kristaps Porzingis was the only other Knicks starter to get into double digits, as he scored 13 on 6 - 17 shooting. Jerami Grant added 14 off the bench (6 - 15 FG), and Deron Williams scored 11 in 21 minutes of play (4 - 9 FG). The Knicks shot a brutal 35 percent from the floor and 4 - 19 (21 percent) from the three - point line in the loss. The Kings continue their road trip Monday in Chicago against the Bulls. The Knicks also play the Bulls in their next game, Wednesday in Chicago.
