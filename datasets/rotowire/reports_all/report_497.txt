While the start of the Grizzlies' season has been pretty standard with a 5 - 5 start, Vince Carter's play has been anything but. With his 20 - point performance on Monday, Carter notched 20 points for the second time in three games and at least 17 points for the third straight game. While Chandler Parson's return from a knee injury was expected to lead to a much - reduced role for Carter, it's done the exact opposite, as with Parson's struggling as he still works to make his way back to the floor, Carter has excelled and outscored Parsons in each of the past three games. Carter's 9 points per game would be his highest average since the 2013 - 14 season. For the Jazz, they received an unexpected 20 - point performance from Joe Ingles on Monday - - a performance that kept the team in the game with Gordon Hayward struggling to get anything going. Ingles had n't scored in double figures all season until Monday, and with Derrick Favors potentially out, the team could look to Ingles to provide some added scoring on a more consistent basis when they're a man down.
