The Chicago Bulls defeated the Toronto Raptors, 105 - 94, at United Center on Tuesday. The Bulls (27 - 29) had looked rather hapless on Sunday against the Timberwolves while playing with a significantly short - handed squad. Jimmy Butler, Dwyane Wade, Nikola Mirotic and Paul Zipser all missed that contest, and matters did n't look much more optimistic heading into Tuesday's tilt. However, Butler was able to ultimately make a return from his heel injury, and his presence unsurprisingly made a considerable impact. The star forward posted a 19 - point, 12 - assist double - double that also included two rebounds and four steals over a full allotment of 38 minutes, and Doug McDermott actually led Chicago with a 20 - point effort off the bench. The Bulls also overcame 17 turnovers by shooting a solid 48 percent from the field and 41 percent from three - point range. The Raptors (32 - 24) were led by Kyle Lowry, who produced 22 points, four assists, three rebounds and one steal. DeMar DeRozan followed with 18 points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal. Norman Powell generated 13 points, four assists, two rebounds and two steals. Jonas Valanciunas posted a near double - double of 12 points and nine boards. Cory Joseph was productive as a reserve as well with 10 points, four rebounds, one assist and one steal. McDermott added five rebounds and one assist to his aforementioned team - high scoring total. Taj Gibson managed 14 points and four boards. Rajon Rondo was next with 12 points, four assists and three rebounds. Cristiano Felicio supplied 10 points, six rebounds, one assist and two steals. Michael Carter-Williams and Robin Lopez registered matching eight - point efforts on the starting five. The Raptors head back home to face the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday evening, while the Bulls remain home to take on the Boston Celtics on Thursday night.
