It's been a rough, potentially final year for Dirk Nowitzki, who has spent majority of this season nursing a sore Achilles. But Monday night against the Timberwolves, the Mavericks organization saw the Nowitzki they had grown so accustomed to seeing for the 18 years he has been with the franchise. The German finished with a season - high 26 points on top of five rebounds and four assists in 31 minutes. It was a performance Nowitzki had n't had since the very first game of this season, when he scored 22 points and eight rebounds in 38 minutes. On top of that, Monday's performance was just the second time this season where he was able to shoot over 50 percent from the field. In the end, the good news for the Mavericks is that while his performance against Minnesota feels like an outlier as of now, Nowitzki appears to be trending in the right direction, having scored in double figures in five straight games.
