The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Washington Wizards 126 - 115 Wednesday at Chesapeake Energy Arena. For the Thunder (12 - 8), they continue to roll as they have now won four in a row after dropping three straight. Wednesday night, Russell Westbrook served as the hero, as not only did he drop yet another triple - double with 35 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists, but he also hit a step - back 3 - pointer in the closing moments to send the game into overtime - - the only three he hit in the game. From there, he would not be denied a victory, as he went on to score 14 of the team's 21 points in the overtime period, outscoring the Wizards, 14 - 10, on his own. Westbrook's night was n't the most efficient, however, as he shot just 12 - of - 35 from the field and 1 - of - 6 from behind the arc. Victor Oladipo, on the other hand, had a very efficient evening, shooting 10 - of - 16 from the field en route to 25 points on top of six rebounds and six assists. The Wizards (6 - 11) are now losers of two of their last three games as they continue to battle inconsistent play early in this season. Bradley Beal, however, has remained consistently deadly since returning from a hamstring injury that sidelined him for three games. His 31 points on Wednesday night was his second straight 30 - point effort in a row and he is now averaging 29 points over his last three games. His partner in the backcourt John Wall struggled shooting from the field, going just 6 - of - 20 overall and 2 - of - 7 from behind the arc, but he did record 15 points and 15 assists - - his second double - double in a row and fourth in the last five games. Washington will look back on this game, however, and see many missed opportunities at the free throw line, where they made just 16 of their 25 attempts. Up next, the Thunder will look to extend their winning streak on Sunday against the Pelicans, while the Wizards will head to San Antonio on Friday to take on the Spurs.
