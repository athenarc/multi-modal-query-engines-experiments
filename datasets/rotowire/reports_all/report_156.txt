While the Pacers have lost two of their last three games, Paul George has been carrying the load for them offensively and on the glass. Tuesday's loss to New York was yet another example of the swingman putting his offensive and rebounding prowess on display. George finished Tuesday's game with a team - high 22 points and 10 rebounds, and it was his third straight game with a double - double from points and rebounds. He's now averaging 23 points and 10 rebounds over those three contests. Across from George on Tuesday, Carmelo Anthony notched a double - double of his own, scoring 22 points and grabbing a game - high 13 rebounds. For Anthony, however, this is a less common occurrence, with Tuesday being his first double - double since late January. Anthony is also on pace this season to have the lowest rebounding averaging of his career since his 2005 - 6 campaign when he averaged just 5 per game.
