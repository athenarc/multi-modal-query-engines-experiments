MEMPHIS - Kevin Durant overcame his early postseason struggles to defeat the staunch Grizzlies defense Thursday and push the series to a deciding Game 7 that will be played Saturday on the Thunder's home court in Oklahoma City. While the Thunder came into the series as the favorites and seeded second in the Western Conference, the Grizzlies appeared to hold the mental advantage most of the series, pushing the Thunder to four consecutive overtime games in Games 2 - 5, before being defeated handily Thursday. Durant and Russell Westbrook took a lot of heat from the press and fans after the series fell to 3 - 2 in favor of the Grizzlies following Tuesday's Game 5 loss, but the duo rebounded in Game 6, finishing with a combined 75 points. The pressure now shifts to the Grizzlies for essentially the first time this series, with the team forced to try and steal another win on the Thunder's raucous home court, where Durant, Westbrook, and company accumulated a record of 34 - 7 during the regular season. Marc Gasol, starting center for the Grizzlies, said that the Grizzlies are ready for the challenge. "We already won two games on their court this series, so we know we can go in there and get a win," he said. "They have great fans, but with all the veterans we have, rowdy fans do n't have as much of an impact as you might see with a team with a younger roster." The adversity the Thunder have faced so far in their first - round series with the Grizzlies has taken some of the shine off their championship lustre, but the dominant display they put on in Game 6 highlights the level at which Durant and Westbrook's Thunder can play when they are playing at their finest.
