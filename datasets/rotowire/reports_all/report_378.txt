The Toronto Raptors (20) were able to pull away on the road from the Boston Celtics (1 - 1) in the second half of Friday’s game, winning by a score of 113 - 103. The two teams were dead even through the first two quarters, as the score was tied 26 - 26 after the first 12 minutes and 54 - 54 at halftime. However, the Raptors eventually used an 80 run in the third quarter to gain separation from the opposition, and maintained that advantage over the final 15 minutes. Terrence Ross was a star performer off the bench for Toronto, notching 21 points on 8 - for - 12 shooting. DeMarre Carroll knocked down four three - pointers to finish with 21 points, while Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan both shook off poor shooting nights to combine for 37 points. The Celtics were undone by the lack of scoring from their starting unit, as only two of the five starters reached double figures in scoring. That offensive deficiency was further exacerbated by the team’s ineffectiveness on the glass, with Toronto outrebounding Boston by a 53 - 38 count. For the second straight game, the Celtics leaned on Isaiah Thomas to drive the offense, and the guard didn’t disappoint with a team - leading 25 points and seven assists. Amir Johnson chipped in 11 points and eight boards off the bench, while fellow frontcourt reserve Kelly Olynyk contributed 11 points of his own. Toronto’s next game will come at home Sunday versus Milwaukee, while Boston will enjoy another home date that same day against San Antonio.
