The New York Knicks (3 - 8) defeated the Denver Nuggets (2 - 7) 109 - 93 on Sunday. New York was coming off a depressing buzzer - beating loss to the Utah Jazz on Friday in which Trey Burke sank a long two - point field goal as time expired. The Knicks' win Sunday marks the end of their seven - game losing streak. Carmelo Anthony has been told by coach Derek Fisher to play his game and not overthink everything trying to perfectly execute the Triangle offense. In his last two games, Anthony has averaged 37 points, indicating that he's possibly starting to find his way within the new system. The Knicks go on the road to Milwaukee on Tuesday to face the Bucks. Denver has been the enigma of the NBA this season. They have a lot of talent, but they ca n't seem to figure out how they want to use it from game to game. As a team, they shot 39 percent from the field and coughed up 17 turnovers to the Knicks on Sunday. The Nuggets suffered through a six - game losing streak already this season, and Sunday's loss may be the start of another losing streak with the team finishing their current three - game roadtrip in Cleveland on Monday against the Cavaliers.
