The Boston Celtics defeated the Chicago Bulls 107 - 100 on Monday at TD Garden. The Celtics (3 - 1) handed the Bulls (3 - 1) their first loss of the regular season as they jumped out to a very hot start, holding a lead that grew to as high as 14 points midway through the second period. Then, Boston's Jae Crowder went down with a sprained left ankle after scoring 10 points in 14 minutes, and from there, the Bulls went on a run to end the half and ultimately closed the gap to within three. The two teams stayed tight, but Boston was able to close out the game and win in the rematch over Chicago. After Crowder went down early, it was Amir Johnson who surprisingly came alive in the second half of the game, as he finished shooting a scorching 9 - of - 11 from the field and 4 - of - 4 from behind the arc. Johnson had only attempted one three through the first three games of the season. Isaiah Thomas matched Johnson's 23 points while adding 10 assists for his first double - double of the regular season. For Chicago, Jimmy Butler reached 20 points for the second game in a row and for the third time in four games this season. He did, however, struggle shooting from the field, going just 8 - of - 21 overall Wednesday. On the other wing, Dwyane Wade continues to struggle since his 22 - point performance in the season opener. For the second straight game, Wade shot just 5 - of - 13 from the field, making him 10 - of - 26 over his last two games for just 27 total points. Up next for Boston, they will head to Cleveland Thursday to take on the Cavaliers, while the Bulls will head home Friday and play the struggling Knicks.
