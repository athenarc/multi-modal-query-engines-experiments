The Toronto Raptors (40) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (2 - 2) 102 - 91 on Tuesday. This was a one - point game going into the final quarter, but the Raptors pulled away by winning the fourth quarter 28 - 18 in a defensive showcase. The biggest differential in the stat line was that the Raptors outscored the Mavericks in the paint 44 - 30. With the Raptors' strength being their backcourt, it was not a huge surprise to see the Mavericks struggle to contain Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan in this matchup, as both scored over 20 points in the victory. The Raptors added to one of their best starts in franchise history by limiting Dallas to 38 percent shooting from the field. The Raptors also outrebounded their opponent for a fourth straight game, and look poised to battle for the top spot in the Eastern Conference this season yet again. They have now won their four games by a combined 47 points and have three straight double - digit victories. Toronto, who was powered by double - doubles from Kyle Lowry and Luis Scola, will have a tough task trying to remain undefeated when they complete a back - to - back in Oklahoma City on Wednesday against the Thunder (3 - 1). The Mavericks struggled to find their shot in this game, as the Raptors smothered them defensively. Dallas was led by Dirk Nowitzki, who finished with 18 points and seven rebounds in the loss. Forward Chandler Pasrsons played just 14 minutes in this game, as he is still working back to get to full strength after knee surgery in the summer. Now that Parsons, Deron Williams, and Wesley Matthews are all on the floor and healthy, the Mavericks look much more promising than they did a few weeks ago. They'll look to bounce - back against the Charlotte Hornets (1 - 3) on Thursday.
