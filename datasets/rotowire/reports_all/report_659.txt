The Los Angeles Lakers (10 - 41) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14 - 36) 119 - 115 on Tuesday night. Los Angeles carried a 10 - game losing streak into this game, but walked away with a much needed win. Both offenses were extremely efficient, as they both shot over 50 percent from the field. The 66 - point first half marked the highest - scoring first half for the Lakers all season and it set a great precedent, as they carried a 14 - point lead into the half. The Timberwolves shot 58 percent from the field and nearly came back in the second half, but simply got too far down to revive themselves. A key statistic was the turnover differential, as the Wolves committed 15 turnovers to the Lakers nine. The Timberwolves had one of their best offensive performances of the season, but still couldnâ€™t pull out a win. They have now lost 20 games in their last 23 with this defeat. They actually shot well over 55 percent from the field in this game and recorded 36 assists on 46 made buckets, so the defense really let them down. Andrew Wiggins was scorching hot, as he scored 30 points before fouling out in the final seconds. Ricky Rubio had a nice game as well, as he dished out 15 assists to go along with 10 points. Minnesota has a quick turnaround, as they play the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday in their next game. An 11 - game losing streak would have been a franchise record for the Lakers, so there was a bit extra motivation in this matchup. Kobe Bryant was questionable coming in, but he may have had his best game of the season. Not only did he hit a bunch of clutch free - throws late, Bryant finished with a season - high 38 points while also recording five rebounds and five assists in the win. Julius Randle also played well, as he recorded 15 points and 12 rebounds en route to yet another double - double. Up next for the Lakers is a game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday.
