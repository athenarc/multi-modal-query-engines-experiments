The Houston Rockets (50 - 23) defeated the Washington Wizards (41 - 32), 99 - 91, on Sunday at the Verizon Center. Sunday's earliest game got off to a sluggish start, especially for the Wizards. For much of the game, Washington's John Wall appeared to be the only Wizard that was playing at full speed. Houston started to let its lead slip away during the fourth quarter when Washington's Otto Porter canned a three to cut it to four. The Rockets answered with consecutive three pointers to extend the lead back to double digits. Every time the Wizards would start to embark on a comeback, the Rockets had an answer. The "Hack a Howard" strategy backfired for the Wizards as Dwight Howard hit five of his eight free throw attempts. Bradley Beal had a chance to cut Houston's lead to three late in the game, but had his shot rejected by James Harden, which all but sealed it for Houston. Houston has now won four in a row, three of which have come on the road. The Rockets are the third - best road team in the league, behind only the Hawks and Warriors with a 23 - 13 mark away from the Toyota Center. Sunday's win temporarily puts Houston in a tie with Memphis for the second sweed in the West. The Grizzlies could fall behind the Rockets if they are unable to notch a victory in San Antonio later in the day Sunday. James Harden led the team in scoring with 24 points on 7 - of - 20 shooting. The Rockets will play the second part of a back - to - back set Monday at the Raptors. Washington snapped its four - game losing streak Friday with an overtime win against Charlotte, but was unable to notch its second straight win Sunday. John Wall barely missed out on a triple - double, finishing with 25 points, 12 assists, and eight rebounds. The Wizards are looking more and more cemented in the fifth spot in the East as they now trail the Raptors by two games. Washington is off until Wednesday when it hosts Philadelphia.
