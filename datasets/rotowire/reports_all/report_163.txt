The Los Angeles Lakers (5 - 13) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3 - 15) 106 - 96 on Tuesday. Los Angeles has won their last two games, defeating the Toronto Raptors 129 - 122 in overtime Sunday before going on the road to beat the Pistons. Kobe Bryant had a dubious triple - double to encore the 31 - point, 11 - rebound and 12 - assist line he put up Sunday. Bryant finished with 12 points, 13 assists and 10 turnovers Tuesday. His barrage of assists have been accompanied by wins for the Lakers, but Bryant has put on passing clinics in small stretches before that faded quickly in the past, indicating that he will likely regress back to being more of a scoring threat than a facilitator most nights. The Lakers have two more games on their road trip, and they'll finish a back - to - back set Wednesday when they go to Washington to take on the Wizards. Detroit has dropped nine straight games. Over their last two contests, they've used Greg Monroe off the bench and shifted Josh Smith to power forward so they could add an extra shooter on the wing. Kyle Singler has started at small forward both gmes, but after he played just 17 minutes Tuesday, it appears his hold on the job may not be too tight. While defense is n't the Lakers' forte, they were successful in limiting the Pistons to 37 percent shooting from the field and 29 percent from beyond the arc. Detroit is playing a back - to - back set, and they'll travel to Boston to take on the Celtics on Wednesday.
