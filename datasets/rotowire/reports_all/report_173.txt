The Detroit Pistons (4 - 19) went on the road and knocked off the Phoenix Suns (12 - 12) 105 - 103 on Friday night at the US Airways Center. Detroit finally got over the hump, snapping their 13 - game losing streak against the Suns on Friday. They were led by a well - rounded team effort in which six players scored in double figures. Andre Drummond was the leader of the pack though, as he scored 23 points (10 - 14 FG, 3 - 4 FT) to go with 14 rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 30 minutes of action. Josh Smith posted a double - double of his own, scoring 12 points (5 - 14 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 4 FT) to go with 11 rebounds. The Pistons saw eight players play 21 minutes or more in this game, and welcomed back shooting guard Jodie Meeks (back), who made his season debut, scoring 12 points (4 - 10 FG, 4 - 4 FT) to go with one rebound, one assist and one steal in 22 minutes. The Pistons continue their road trip Saturday in Sacramento against the Kings. The Suns also saw production from all over the roster, with seven players scoring in double figures. The leader was Goran Dragic, putting up 18 points (8 - 12 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) to go with five assists, five rebounds and two steals. P.J. Tucker had possibly the most impressive game, though, as he filled up the stat sheet, scoring 16 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT) to go with nine rebounds, three assists and three steals in 33 minutes. The Suns also welcomed back Isaiah Thomas from his ankle injury, and he played 28 minutes off the bench, scoring 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT). Phoenix has now lost four games in a row, and they'll look to turn it around on Sunday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder.
