The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 111 - 80 at Staple Center on Wednesday. The matchup was never close. The Clippers (7 - 1) took a 20 points lead at the end of the first quarter and simply built upon the Blazers (5 - 4) shooters being unable to bury a shot from the low post, to the midrange and behind the arc. It was not a particularly spectacular defensive effort by Los Angeles, rather the matchup advantage of Chris Paul on Damian Lillard. The Blazers point guard was ice cold, as he finished just 1 - of - 10 from the field and 0 - of - 4 from three point territory. The rest of the Portland team was unable to bail out the rough performance from Lillard, as C.J. McCollum and Maurice Harkless matched their starting point guard with eight points in the loss. Los Angeles, on the other hand, did not need any form of expert shooting to build upon an early lead, but did turn in effective performances from their starters. Blake Griffin led the way for Los Angeles, as he finished with 22 points, 13 rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block on 7 - of - 14 shooting. Chris Paul added 19 points and seven assists, while J.J. Reddick scored 10 points on 3 - of - 5 shooting. The bench was once again led by Marreese Speights, who contributed 12 points, eight rebounds and an assist in the win. Next up, the Clippers visit the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday, while the Blazers will return home the same day to host the Sacramento Kings.
