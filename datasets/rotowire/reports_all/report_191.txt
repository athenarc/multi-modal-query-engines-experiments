The Golden State Warriors (36 - 7) fell to the Chicago Bulls (30 - 17) in overtime Tuesday by a score of 113 - 111. In an incredible, back - and - fourth game between the league's best home team and third - best road team, the Bulls came out on top. Golden State was unable to extend their home winning streak to 20 games as Klay Thompson's last second floater was off the mark. The Warriors were uncharacteristically cold from beyond the arc, going 0 - 13 from three in the second half and overtime. The adage "live by the three, die by the three" rang true Tuesday night for the Warriors. Chicago kicked off its pivotal six - game road trip with a feat that only one other team has accomplished this season, beating the Warriors at the Oracle Arena. Derrick Rose finished the night with an interesting stat - line, with 30 points on 33 shots, one assist, and a career - high 11 turnovers. Stats never tell the whole story, however. Rose's last shot was a step - back three with seven seconds remaining to give the Bulls the final lead. The Bulls will continue its road trip on Thursday against the Lakers. Golden State had n't lost at home since Nov. 13, when it fell to San Antonio 113 - 100. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 51 points, but were just 6 - for - 19 from beyond the arc. The Warriors were missing Andrew Bogut, who was a late scratch after coming down with flu - like symptoms. Despite Tuesday's loss, the Warriors still hold a four - and - a - half game lead in the West. Golden State will look to rebound from its loss to Chicago on Friday in Utah.
