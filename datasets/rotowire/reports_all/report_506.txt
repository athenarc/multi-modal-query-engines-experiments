The San Antonio Spurs (15 - 5) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (4 - 15) 123 - 101 on Saturday. San Antonio has won 10 of their last 11 games. They rested Tony Parker, who suffered a mild hamstring injury in Friday's win over the Memphis Grizzlies, and Manu Ginobili (rest) for this game. While coach Gregg Popovich planned to have Tim Duncan sit out as well, the Big Fundamental insisted on playing, and he put up 13 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in 19 minutes. Cory Joseph filled in as the starter at point guard and led the way for the Spurs, putting up 18 points and five assists in 33 minutes. San Antonio's next game is on the road against the Utah Jazz on Tuesday. Minnesota has lost five straight, and the injury bug continues to infect them. Ricky Rubio (ankle), Kevin Martin (wrist) and Nikola Pekovic (wrist) remain out in what seems like perpetuity, and Mo Williams was held out of Friday and Saturday's games with back spasms, leaving Zach LaVine as the only healthy point guard on the roster. LaVine did his best to step up, finshing with the first double - double of his career (22 points, 10 rebounds) in 42 minutes. It's not going to get easier for the Timberwolves anytime soon. They host the Golden State Warriors on Monday.
