The Portland Trail Blazers (34 - 16) went on a huge fourth quarter run to secure the victory over the Phoenix Suns (28 - 23) 108 - 87 Thursday at the Moda Center. This was a surprisingly low - scoring game through the first two quarters as both teams struggled from the field. Phoenix outscored Portland 30 - 20 in the third quarter but was unable to sustain that pace as the Trail Blazers outscored the Suns by 20 points in the fourth. LaMarcus Aldridge's 19 point, 13 rebound double - double made him Portland's all - time leader in double - doubles. Portland has now strung together consecutive victories for the first time since early January. All five Portland starters scored in double figures, led by Nicolas Batum's 20 points. The Trail Blazers dominated the boards, out - rebounding the Suns 57 - 42. Portland has a huge game Saturday in Dallas as the Trail Blazers currently hold a one game lead over the Mavericks. Phoenix is slumping at the wrong time, having lost three straight and five of its last ten. The Pelicans are just one game behind the Suns for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference and have won seven of their last ten contests. Phoenix suffered a loss to its already average front court as Alex Len went down with an ankle sprain. The Suns will finish up its back - to - back set Friday when they host the Jazz.
