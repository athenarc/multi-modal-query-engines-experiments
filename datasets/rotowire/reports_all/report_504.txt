The Indiana Pacers (18 - 32) defeated the Detroit Pistons (19 - 31) 114 - 109 on Wednesday. George Hill led Indiana with 20 points and six assists in 26 minutes. He returned to the starting lineup after coming off the bench for five games, since returning from a groin injury. The 26 minutes are the most he has played since coming back. Backup center Ian Mahinmi left after suffering a sprained ankle and did not return. C.J. Miles got the start at small forward, finishing with 15 points and three steals in 27 minutes. Miles replaced Solomon Hill, who had started all but one game this season. The Pacers have now won three of their last five games. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope left the game with an Achilles injury after playing just three minutes. Jodie Meeks came in and helped pick up the slack with 13 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench. He is likely to be the man if Caldwell-Pope misses extended time. D.J. Augustin had played well in Detroit's two games prior to Wednesday, averaging 27 points and 13 assists in those winning efforts. However, he finished with 12 points, six assists and four fouls in 32 minutes. The Pistons will host the Denver Nuggets on Friday, and the Pacers will face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.
