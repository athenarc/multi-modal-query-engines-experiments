It was a dominant offensive performance Wednesday from the Wizards' three young stars in John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr. Not only did the three starters put up impressive scoring numbers, but they did so in very efficient fashion. With Wall's 30 points, Beal's 25 and Porter's 22, the trio combined to score an impressive 63 percent of Washington's 123 points Wednesday. But what is even more astounding, is that they hardly missed any shots in the process. Wall, Beal and Porter combined to shoot a scorching 31 - of - 49 (63 percent) from the field and 9 - of - 16 (56 percent) from behind the arc. That shooting ended up being contagious, as the other two starters managed to shoot over 50 percent from the field as well, and as a team, the Wizards shot a wildly impressive 57 percent.
