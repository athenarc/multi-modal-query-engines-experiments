The Portland Trail Blazers (31 - 11) beat the Sacramento Kings (16 - 25), 98 - 94, on Monday. LaMarcus Aldridge was removed from the game with a left thumb injury in the second quarter and did n't return. He had 10 points and two steals in 14 minutes before he exited. In Aldridge's absence, Thomas Robinson and Meyers Leonard had to pick up the slack. They combined for 14 points and nine rebounds off the bench to help out the short - handed frontcourt that is already missing Robin Lopez (hand) and Joel Freeland (shoulder). DeMarcus Cousins came back strong for the Kings after missing Saturday's game against the Clippers with an ankle injury. He finished with 22 points, 19 rebounds, and four blocks. Darren Collison turned in a nice game with 13 points, seven rebounds, and eight assists. After coming off the bench Saturday, Rudy Gay returned to the starting lineup and shot 10 - for - 19 from the field for 26 points. Ramon Sessions was available to play but did n't get into the action. He's been out since Dec. 22 with a back injury. Jason Thompson returned to Earth after recording his first 20 - 20 game in Cousin's absence on Saturday, posting just four points and seven rebounds in 28 minutes. The Kings will head home to face the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday, and the Trail Blazers will travel to Phoenix to face the Suns.
