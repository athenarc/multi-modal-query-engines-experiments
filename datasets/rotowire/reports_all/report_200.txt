Salah Mejri's performance in Wednesday's victory over the 76ers was more than just a completely surprise, it was completely out of character. With his 16 - point, 17 - rebound performance, Mejri scored the second highest point total of his career, with 17 being the highest, and recorded a career - high 17 rebounds in just 21 minutes. In the season and a half he's played in the NBA, Mejri had recorded just two career double - doubles before Wednesday night, and they both came against the Trail Blazers within three days of each other. This season alone, Mejri only had two games where he recorded double - digit rebounds and Wednesday was his first double - digit scoring outing of the 2016 - 17 season. With Bogut steal dealing with a lingering hamstring injury, Mejri's performance against Philadelphia may have given the Mavericks some much - needed insurance in their frontcourt rotation.
