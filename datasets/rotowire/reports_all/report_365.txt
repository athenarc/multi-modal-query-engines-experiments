The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Charlotte Hornets in OT 124 - 121 at Staples Center on Sunday. The Clippers (36 - 23) are still tied with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 5 - seed in the Western Conference, but pulled out a needed win with opening day starters on the court. Kemba Walker single handedly took the Hornets (25 - 34) to overtime after draining a 25 - foot three - pointer to bring the game within two points with :36 remaining in the fourth quarter, and then finished the job at the free throw line on the next possession to tie the game at 113 points a piece. In OT, both teams went back - and - forth during the first two minutes, but the Hornets Marvin Williams fouled Blake Griffin and put him on the line to give the Clippers a one point lead. Walker's heroics at the end of the fourth quarter will be overshadowed by a bad pass that was stolen by DeAndre Jordan, who also finished with a dunk on the other end with a few ticks left on the clock. Blake Griffin had a monsterous game evidenced by his 43 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and two steals on 15 - of - 26 shooting across 42 minutes. Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan also stacked the box score. The Clippers star point guard finished with 15 points, 17 assists and nine rebounds, while Jordan scored 20 points and hauled in 19 rebounds. J.J. Reddick scored 19 points in the first half, but had trouble continuing the hot hand in the second half. Reddick finished with 22 points on 3 - of - 7 shooting from behind the arc. Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum led the Hornets in scoring with 34 points and 31 points, respectively, while Jeremy Lamb was effective off the bench in his 37 minutes of action. Batum was more well rounded in his performance and added eight rebounds and four assists. Next up, the Hornets host the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, while the Clippers visit the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.
