The Cleveland Cavaliers (13 - 7) defeated the Toronto Raptors (16 - 6) 105 - 101 on Tuesday. Cleveland has won eight straight games, keeping their spot with the fourth - best record in the Eastern Conference, trailing only the Raptors, Atlanta Hawks and Washington Wizards. The Cavs and Raptors have played three games against each other already this season, with the Raptors taking their first matchup and the Cavaliers taking the last two. LeBron James took on the scoring load Tuesday, finishing with 35 points, while Kyrie Irving facilitated and finished with a double - double of 13 points and 10 assists. Mike Miller has missed the last three games with a concussion. Tuesday was the earliest he could have returned, but he was n't ready. Toronto has dropped two of their last three games, both losses coming against the Cavaliers. DeMar DeRozan's absence with an adductor injury is having a noticeable impact on the Raptors. They used Greivis Vasquez as the fill - in starter at shooting guard for the first five games DeRozan was out, but they opted to move Vasquez back to the bench and insert Landry Fields into the starting lineup Tuesday to try and put a bigger player on the wing to guard James. The Raptors took the game down to the wire, with Jonas Valanciunas (18 points, 15 rebounds) and Kyle Lowry (16 points, 14 assists) both putting up double - doubles, but their quality performances were n't enough to put the Raptors over the top.
