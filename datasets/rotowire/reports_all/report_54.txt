The Bulls hung around all game, but the Knicks led for nearly 40 minutes in an impressive performance. The second half is when New York really turned it on, as they scored 61 points and committed just one turnover. The assist - to - turnover margin was a huge factor, as the Bulls committed 12 turnovers with 15 assists, while the Knicks committed just five turnovers to their 31 assists. The 27 points from Kristaps Porzingis marks a season - high and this is the first time all season that all five starters scored in double figures. The 11 assists from Derrick Rose more than doubles his previous season - high of five. The 35 points and five three - pointers are a season - high for Dwyane Wade as well, as those five threes nearly matches his season total from last season. The 75 combined points from Wade, Jimmy Butler and Nikola Mirotic were the only reason Chicago hung around, as the other nine players combined for just 29 points.
