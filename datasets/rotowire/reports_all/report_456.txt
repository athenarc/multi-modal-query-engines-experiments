It was one of the best nights of the season for Washington, as the Wizards blew out their divisional rival by almost 30 points. Rising star Otto Porter Jr. was at the forefront of the winning effort, leading the team with 21 points while pulling down 11 rebounds. Star point guard John Wall, meanwhile, scored 19 while dishing out a team - leading nine assists. Though the Wizards typically shoot few three - pointers, Friday was a different story. The team buried 13 - of - 31 three - point shots. Atlanta, meanwhile, had an abysmal night from the field. The Hawks shot just 36 percent and under 30 percent from three - point range. It may have been the worst night of the season for All-Star Paul Millsap, who shot just 1 - of - 7 for four points and four rebounds. Center Dwight Howard, however, had a double - double with 12 points and 13 boards.
