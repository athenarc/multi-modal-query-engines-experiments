Gordon Hayward's earlier - than - anticipated return saw him rattle off a team - high 28 points, despite the fact that he drained only six of 17 field - goal attempts. He remained aggressive throughout, however, resulting in 14 visits to the free - throw line that helped boost his scoring total significantly. The entire Jazz first unit had the hot hand, as they shot 55 percent (32 - of - 58) as a group, with all five players hitting double digits on the scoreboard. The Knicks put on an impressive offensive performance themselves, tallying a 51 percent success rate from the field. Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis combined for 56 points, with each player compiling half, and also had 17 rebounds between them. Derrick Rose registered 18 points, but scoring was scarce from the rest of the roster, with the remaining seven players totaling just 35 points.
