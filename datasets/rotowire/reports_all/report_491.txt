The Chicago Bulls blew out the host Brooklyn Nets on Monday, 118 - 88. Chicago (30) remained undefeated after handily winning its first road game. The Bulls got off to a hot start Monday, outscoring the Nets 38 - 20 in the first quarter. The lead only grew from there, as Chicago outscored Brooklyn in each of the three ensuing quarters. Rebounding played a major role in the win for the Bulls, as they established an 58 - 45 edge on the glass. Chicago's rebounding advantage showed the same dominance on the glass that the team exhibited in its 55 - rebound season opener against the Boston Celtics. Scoring was no problem, either, for the Bulls on Monday, as seven players recorded double digits in the points column. All-Star Jimmy Butler lead the team with 22. For Brooklyn (1 - 3), scoring the ball did not prove quite as easy. The team hit just 34 percent of its shots from the floor, including a lackluster 16 percent from beyond the arc. Guard Bojan Bogdanovic had a team - high 15 points and was one of only four Nets to score in double figures. he Nets also saw a significant disadvantage in terms of ball movement, evidenced by the team's measly 14 assists on the night. The Bulls, meanwhile, recorded 26 assists, accounting for 58 percent of their made field goals on the night. Both teams will take the floor again on Wednesday, with the Bulls taking on the Celtics and the Nets hosting the Detroit Pistons.
