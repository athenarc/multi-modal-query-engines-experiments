The Cleveland Cavaliers (51 - 27) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (38 - 40) 104 - 99 on Wednesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee. The Cavaliers are now riding a four - game win streak and have clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The Bucks, on the other hand, are currently the sixth projected playoff seed in the East. Both the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets are just two games back from them though, so they'll need to pick up some important wins over these final four games of the regular season in order to lock up that six seed. Despite suffering the loss, the Bucks were the superior shooting team, going 50 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three - point line, while the Cavaliers finished at 49 percent from the floor and 32 percent from deep. While many teams have been giving their players some time off for rest, coach David Blatt decided to keep his star players in the lineup with a full minutes load Wednesday. Both LeBron James and Kyrie Irving had impressive showings. James finished with 21 points (8 - 15 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), nine rebounds and eight assists, while Irving recorded 27 points (7 - 13 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt, 9 - 11 FT), nine assists and three steals. James has now posted 20 or more points in eight straight games, a stretch where he's averaging 23 points. Irving has put in two impressive performances in a row as well, combining for 54 points, 13 assists and six steals during that span. Kevin Love did his part in the victory, going 7 - for - 14 from the field, but just 1 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 16 points, while also adding 11 rebounds to notch a double - double. Tristan Thompson posted a double - double off the bench as well, finishing with 11 points (3 - 3 FG, 5 - 5 FT) and 10 rebounds. Michael Carter-Williams had one of his best offensive performances since joining the Bucks. He went 13 - for - 22 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 30 points, while also adding eight assists over 36 minutes. Carter-Williams has struggled with his shot lately, combining to go 7 - for - 22 from the field over his two previous games, so it was a step in the right direction for the guard, who recorded a new season - high in points. Zaza Pachulia had a strong day from the field as well. He finished with 19 points (8 - 13 FG, 3 - 5 FT), 10 rebounds and five steals. The five steals matched a season - high, while the double - double was his second of his last five games. Khris Middleton was hitting nearly all of his shots as well. He posted 16 points, while shooting 7 - of - 10 from the field and a perfect 2 - of - 2 from deep. The only other Buck in double figures was OJ Mayo, who came off the bench for 11 points (4 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Friday, while the Bucks will travel to New York to play the Knicks on Friday.
