The Los Angeles Clippers (39 - 21) defeated the Chicago Bulls (37 - 23) 96 - 86 on Sunday. Los Angeles have won two straight games and are 6 - 3 since Blake Griffin started sitting out games following surgery to remove an infection in his elbow. DeAndre Jordan continued his torrid work on the glass, pulling down 26 rebounds in 41 minutes. With Griffin out, Jordan has stepped up his game. He's recorded four games of 20 - plus rebounds over his last nine contests. Chris Paul has also picked up his game to cover the team's holes. Paul put up a team - high 29 points and 12 assists Sunday and has recorded double - digit assists in eight of his last nine games. Chicago were playing without Derrick Rose (knee) and Taj Gibson (ankle) on Sunday, and without Rose to initiate the offense, the team struggled, shooting 31 percent from the field. Pau Gasol returned to action, playing through the illness that held him out of Friday's game, but he had trouble against the Clippers' defense, shooting 2 - for - 13 from the field in 33 minutes to finish with just four points. He worked the glass for 15 rebounds, but with their shots not falling, the Bulls could n't make up the slack elsewhere. Aaron Brooks started a second straight game in place of Rose, who is expected to be sidelined four to six weeks following knee surgery. Brooks finished with 14 points on 5 - of - 17 shooting from the field. With Gibson unavailable, Nikola Mirotic put up a game - high 29 points in 31 minutes off the bench. The Clippers and Bulls split their season series 1 - 1, with the Bulls having taken their first matchup 105 - 89 back on Nov. 17. Los Angeles will wrap up their road trip against the Timberwolves on Monday, and Chicago will stay home to host the Wizards on Tuesday.
