The recent form of these teams would indicate an easy Cleveland win, but that did n't take into consideration the circumstances. What really changed things was the fact that the Cavaliers were without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, as they did n't have enough in the tank to win this game. LeBron James did all he could though, as he tallied 31 points, eight rebounds and seven assists in the loss. Jordan McRae got the start for Irving and finished second on the team with 21 points. Jimmy Butler turned it on late, as he scored 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter to seal the win. He also added six rebounds and eight assists to his tally. Taj Gibson went 9 - of - 10 from the field to total 18 points and seven rebounds. Nikola Mirotic and Doug McDermott were huge off the bench, as they combined for 33 points and 10 rebounds.
