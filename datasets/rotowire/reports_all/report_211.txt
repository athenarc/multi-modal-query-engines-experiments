The visiting Golden State Warriors routed the Oklahoma City Thunder once again on Monday night, 111 - 95. Klay Thompson and Steph Curry showed the reason for their "Splash Brothers" moniker on Monday, combining for 14 three - pointers as Golden State (56 - 14) cruised to victory. Thompson was the high scorer for the Warriors, as he poured in 34 points in just 32 minutes of play time. Curry, meanwhile, scored 23 and dished out six assists. Little offensive production was needed outside of the two All-Stars, though the rest of the team still managed to impress on that end. As a whole, the Dubs shot over 48 percent from the field and recorded a stellar 28 team assists. OKC (40 - 30) came into the game relatively hot but were stopped cold by the powerhouse Warriors. It was an off night for superstar point guard Russell Westbrook, though for a monster like Westbrook, that term is obviously relative. Westbrook still managed to fill the stat sheet with 15 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists. However, he shot a dismal 4 - of - 16 from the field and turned the ball over five times. As a team, it was a remarkably poor offensive night for the Thunder. They made just over 42 percent of their shots and could not hit the deep ball, going just 4 - of - 21 from beyond the arc. The Warriors will visit Dallas on Tuesday, while OKC will host the 76ers on Wednesday.
