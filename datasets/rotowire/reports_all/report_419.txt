The Denver Nuggets defeated the Golden State Warriors 132 - 110 Monday at Pepsi Center. The Warriors (46 - 9) entered Wednesday's contest without Klay Thompson (heel), and the Nuggets (25 - 30) elected to take full advantage. The result was the game essentially being over by halftime, with Denver holding a convincing 25 - point advantage after the first 24 minutes of the game. In the second half, the Nuggets refused to let up, as they continued to be carried by their rising star Nikola Jokic. Jokic recorded a triple - double of 17 points, 21 rebounds and 12 assists in 36 minutes. But it did n't stop there for Denver, as three starters managed to score at least 20 points Monday night, with Juan Hernangomez scoring a game - high 27 points to go along with 10 rebounds, Will Barton scoring 24 points and Jameer Nelson adding 23 of his own. As a team, the Nuggets were simply unstoppable from behind the arc, shooting 60 percent from long range. As for Golden State, it was simply not their night in the high altitude at the Pepsi Center. Kevin Durant was remarkably efficient, scoring 25 points in 27 minutes, but it was n't nearly enough to tame the high - powered Denver offense. Steph Curry really struggled, putting together one of his worst performances of the season and finishing with just 11 points on a brutal 4 - of - 18 shooting from the field. As a team, the Warriors managed to shoot just 8 - of - 32 from behind the arc, with the starting five hitting just five of their 23 3 - point attempts. Up next, the Nuggets will look to build on this victory Wednesday against the Timberwolves, while the Warriors will look to bounce back Wednesday in a revenge game against the Kings.
