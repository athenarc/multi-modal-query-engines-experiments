The Sacramento Kings (25 - 45) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (17 - 54) 107 - 106 on Tuesday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento. Despite already having been eliminated from the playoffs, the Kings finished with another solid win Tuesday, pushing their streak to three in a row. The Kings shot much worse from the field and three - point line than the Sixers, but were able to force them into 21 turnovers, while committing just 10 of their own, so that ended up being the difference in this one. They also had a large advantage from the free throw line, converting on 30 - of - 38 attempts, while the Sixers made just 13 - of - 21. It was the duo of DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay who led the Kings to this win. Cousins was nearly unstoppable, finishing with a game - high of 33 points (8 - 27 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 17 - 19 FT), to go along with 17 rebounds, four steals and four blocked shots. It was the third game over his last five where he scored 30 points or more, as he's been an absolute force. During that five - game stretch, he's averaging 26 points, 13 rebounds and a block, while shooting 48 percent from the field. Gay, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 19 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 21 points, while also adding eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He's also been very consistent with his production of late, and is averaging 26 points and 5 rebounds over his last five games. The only other King in double figures was Ray McCallum, who scored 11 points (5 - 17 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 0 - 2 FT) and added six rebounds as the starter at point guard. Robert Covington shot the ball well Tuesday, going 7 - for - 9 from the field and 5 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 21 points. He had really been struggling offensively over his last four games, shooting less than 35 percent from the field in three out of those four, so it was refreshing to see him have much more success this time around. Nerlens Noel came out and notched a double - double, finishing with 14 points (5 - 10 FG, 4 - 5 FT), 10 rebounds and six blocked shots. He's on a solid stretch of seven games, where he's averaging 15 points, 9 rebounds and two blocked shots, so that trend continued Tuesday. Coming off the bench, Thomas Robinson chipped in with 16 points and eight rebounds as well, as he went 7 - for - 12 from the field in just 21 minutes of action. The Kings' next game will be on the road against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, while the Sixers will travel to Denver to play the Nuggets on Wednesday.
