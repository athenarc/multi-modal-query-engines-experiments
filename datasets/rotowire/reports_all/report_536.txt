The Portland Trail Blazers (33 - 28) continued their ridiculous hot streak on Tuesday, beating the New York Knicks (25 - 37) 104 - 85 at Madison Square Garden. Portland has now won 13 of its last 15 games. Despite most preseason projections placing the Blazers squarely in the lottery, the surprising young team has emerged as the sixth - place team in the Western Conference with a real chance to make it to fifth by the season's end. Much of the credit for Portland's meteoric rise must be given to point guard Damian Lillard, of course, whose averages of 30 points and 7 assists per game helped Portland to the league's second - best record in the month of February. Lillard took the reigns once again on Tuesday, pouring in 30 points including a perfect 10 - for - 10 from the line. Guard C.J. McCollum was also an integral piece, as he exploded for 25 points. McCollum has emerged as one of the league's biggest breakout stars this season, making Portland one of just two teams in the association with multiple guards averaging over 20 points per game. No other Portland starter notched more than four points, but it did n't seem to matter, as the dynamic duo's 55 combined points were enough to bury the struggling Knicks. For New York, poor shooting was the story of the night. The team posted splits of just 38/29/72 in what was a truly abysmal night from the field. While perennial All-Star Carmelo Anthony scored a team - leading 23 points, no other Knick eclipsed 13 on the night, and only four scored in double - digits. Last year's last - place team is once again beginning to slide towards the bottom of the East, as the Knicks now sit at 12 games below .500. New York will attempt to bounce back against the surging Celtics in Boston on Friday. Portland, meanwhile, will be visiting Boston two days earlier for a Wednesday matchup against another red - hot team.
