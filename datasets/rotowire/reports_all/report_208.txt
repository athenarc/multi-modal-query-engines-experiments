Kobe Bryant played 34 minutes and led the Lakers in scoring with 21 points, shooting 7 - 20 from the field. Julius Randle has been a glimmer of hope in this terrible season for the Lakers. Randle played a strong game Saturday night shooting 8 - 13 from the field and finished with 16 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals in 29 minutes. Jordan Clarkson contributed 19 points, four assists, four steals and three rebounds, while D'Angelo Russell added 16 points, five assists and four rebounds.

McCollum finished with 28 points on strong 12 - 20 shooting from the field, including 4 - 7 from deep. No other players scored in double digits for the Blazers. Meyers Leonard was back in action after recovering from a dislocated shoulder, and posted seven points, six rebounds and one block in 21 minutes off the bench. Next up for Portland will be a trip to L.A. to face the Clippers on Monday, a game the Clippers will not want to let slip. Meanwhile, the Lakers will be right back in action on Sunday as they host Indiana.
