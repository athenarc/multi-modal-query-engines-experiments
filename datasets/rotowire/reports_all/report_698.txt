The Golden State Warriors (8 - 2) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (6 - 5) 108 - 95 in Game 6 of their second - round playoff series on Friday in Memphis and have won the series 4 - 2. The Warriors were in control for majority of the game, but the Grizzlies were able to rally late in the third quarter and bring Golden State’s lead down to just five. Memphis had the ball for the final shot of the period, but after Jeff Green’s shot was blocked, Stephen Curry launched a 60 - foot heave towards his team’s basket and sunk the shot. The shot put the Warriors up eight and they never looked back after the swing of momentum. Curry led the way for Golden State, as while he struggled shooting from close range, he was absolutely unstoppable from behind the arc. He finished with 32 points while shooting 8 - of - 13 from the 3 - point line (11 - 25 FG) to go along with six rebounds and 10 assists in 39 minutes. Klay Thompson also had a solid shooting night for the Warriors, posting 20 points (7 - 13 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt), eight rebounds and three assists in 37 minutes. Draymond Green posted yet another double - double of 16 points (6 - 11 FG) and 12 rebounds, giving him his seventh double - double of the playoffs. Harrison Barnes was the fourth and final Golden State starter to score in double figures, posting 13 points in 36 minutes, while Sean Livingston scored 10 points in 20 minutes off the bench. As a team, the Warriors shot an astounding 51 percent from the field and 47 percent from behind the arc, and with the win, they have punched their ticket to the Western Conference Finals, where they will play the winner of Game 7 between the Rockets and Clippers. Unfortunately for the Grizzlies, they were unable to have the same kind of shooting success Friday night, as they shot just 37 percent from the field and 25 percent from three. It was their free throw shooting that kept them in the game, as they went 23 - of - 30 from the charity stripe, but that ultimately was not enough. They were lead by Marc Gasol, who scored 21 points (7 - 23 FG, 7 - 10 FT) and grabbed 15 rebounds in 44 minutes in his final game before he hits free agency this summer. Zach Randolph was not as active as he tends to be on the boards, as he grabbed just six rebounds to go along with 15 points (5 - 14 FG) in 33 minutes. Just three other Memphis players managed to score in double figures, with Courtney Lee (12) and Mike Conley (11) rounding out the starters, while Vince Carter posted 16 points in 26 minutes off the bench. Tony Allen, who started the game despite fighting a hamstring injury, only played five minutes in the first half and did not return to play in the second due to issues with the injury. Green started the second half and played 31 minutes, but he was not able to make the most of his time, scoring just six points (2 - 8 FG) and grabbing seven rebounds in that time.
