Kevin Love has had a great start to the 2016 - 17 season and has looked like his old self, averaging 22 points and 11 rebounds per game thus far. His start to January, however, has been anything but great. Tuesday night against the Jazz, Love posted just 12 points and nine rebounds in 37 minutes while shooting a sorry 4 - of - 14 from the field and 2 - of - 6 from behind the arc. When comparing it to the first two months of the season, it would be completely out of character, but when compared to his other games this January, it looks much more normal. In the three games he's played this month, Love has shot over 33 percent from the field just once and is shooting a woeful 27 percent from behind the arc to start the new year. So, while his numbers look solid - - he's averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds through those four games - - Love is playing at an alarmingly inefficient rate.
