The San Antonio Spurs (34 - 19) defeated the Detroit Pistons (21 - 33) 104 - 87 on Wednesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills. The Spurs came out and got off to a quick start in this one, out - scoring the Pistons 20 - 12 right away in the first quarter. To go along with the quick start, the Spurs also shot the ball well, going 47 percent from the field, while the Pistons went 41 percent from the floor. To put the icing on the cake, the Spurs finished with a 45 - 36 rebounding advantage, helping push them to a convincing 17 - point victory. The Spurs backcourt of Tony Parker and Danny Green did the bulk of the damage for the Spurs in this one. Green went 7 - for - 13 from the field and 5 - for - 10 from the three - point line to finish with 19 points, while also adding eight rebounds and four assists. After failing to reach double figures in points over his last four games, he finally got back into a rhythm and led the team in scoring Wednesday. Parker was just behind Green, recording 17 points (6 - 10 FG, 5 - 5 FT), three rebounds and six assists. He's put in two great performances in a row, combining for 36 points and 12 assists during that stretch. After coming off the bench Monday, Aron Baynes moved back into the starting lineup. In 24 minutes, he posted 12 points (6 - 8 FG) and four rebounds. Both Manu Ginobili and Marco Belinelli reached double - digit points off the bench, with 13 and 10 points respectively. Like the Spurs, the majority of the Pistons offense came from their backcourt. Point guard DJ Augustin finished with 22 points (8 - 18 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), three rebounds and six assists. He's been very impressive lately, averaging 21 points and 8 assists over his last four games. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also had a solid showing, posting 20 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds. Considering he's averaging 12 points on the season, it was a nice surprise for the Pistons. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Andre Drummond, who nearly recorded a double - double with 10 points (4 - 10 FG, 2 - 6 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. It was his lowest scoring performance over his last six games, as he could n't get anything going against the Spurs. It was the third time in his last four games with two blocks though. The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday after the All-Star break, while the Pistons will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Friday after the All-Star break as well.
