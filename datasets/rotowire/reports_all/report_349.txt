The Chicago Bulls defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 128 - 100 at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday. The Bulls (25 - 25) pulled out an impressive victory on the road against the Thunder (28 - 22). Chicago found a sixth gear from the second quarter through the remainder of the matchup, dropping over 30 points per quarter and steadily building upon a halftime lead. Dwyane Wade, Nikola Mirotic and Jimmy Butler put together a strong trio, and midway through the third quarter, there was not much the Thunder could do to match the pace Chicago was playing at. Six Bulls players finished scoring in double figures, led by Butler's team high 28 points on 11 - of - 17 shooting. Butler added four rebounds, five assists and three steals across 30 minutes of action. Wade added 18 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in 24 minutes, while eight Chicago players came off the bench to provide some rest for the starters in the fourth quarter. Russell Westbrook had a quiet outing as compared to most of his campaign so far, as the Thunder point guard finished with 28 points, eight assists and five rebounds on 10 - of - 23 shooting in 29 minutes. Victor Oladipo aided Westbrook in double figures with 12 points, but the starters were simply not able to find a rhythm, especially the front court. Domantas Sabonis, Andre Roberson and Steven Adams combined for a lowly 15 points and 17 rebounds. Both teams play on Friday, as the Thunder host the Memphis Grizzlies, while the Bulls visit the Houston Rockets.
