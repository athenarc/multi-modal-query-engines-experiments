The Golden State Warriors (53 - 5) staged an almost unfathomable comeback to defeat the host Oklahoma City Thunder (41 - 18) in overtime, 121 - 118. Reigning MVP Steph Curry hit the game - winning shot, a record - tying 12th in the game. Curry had broken his own single - season three - point record earlier in the game. The Warriors continued their historically good season with the win in OKC, keeping up pace to break the 1995 - 96 Bulls' record of 72 - 10 in the regular season. MVP Steph Curry led the way throughout, despite having to leave for the locker room after turning his ankle in the third quarter. Curry had 12 of the Warriors' 14 threes - pointers, going 14 - for - 24 overall from the floor. Power forward Draymond Green, meanwhile, had 14 rebounds, 14 assists, four blocks, and six steals, but scored just two points on 0 - for - 8 shooting. Green allegedly went on an expletive - filled tirade in the locker room at halftime, insisting that he is "not a robot." Despite this, the Warriors staged a comeback late in the game despite trailing until the final two minutes. The Thunder held a 62 - 32 advantage on the boards, but still were unable to put the game away. Former MVP Kevin Durant went off for 37 points including seven three - pointers. Big man Serge Ibaka also contributed heavily, pulling down 20 rebounds. It appeared as though OKC had the game in the bag, when a late - game turnover by Kevin Durant allowed veteran Andre Iguodala to get to the free - throw line and tie the game with 1 seconds left. The loss puts OKC at 1 - 4 after the All-Star Break, and the team is now nine games back from second place in the West. The Warriors will return home to face the Hawks on Tuesday. The Thunder, meanwhile, will visit the Kings in Sacramento on Monday.
