The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Chicago Bulls, 101 - 91, at United Center on Saturday night. The Clippers (37 - 25) had checked in to Saturday night uncharacteristically struggling, particularly on defense. They'd lost four of their five games coming out of the All-Star break and had surrendered over 120 points in three of those contests. However, they got back to fundamental Clippers basketball against the Bulls (31 - 31), limiting them to 42 percent shooting from the field and 35 percent from three - point range, while also eliciting 19 turnovers. Jamal Crawford stepped up off the bench by scoring a game - high 25 points and adding two rebounds, two assists and two steal, and four other players also hit double digits in the scoring column. Chris Paul was next behind Crawford with 17 points, four assists, two rebounds, two steals and one block. Blake Griffin followed with 16 points, seven assists and six rebounds. J.J. Redick was effective in his usual complementary role, registering 13 points and one rebound. Luc Mbah a Moute had a rare offensive outburst by his standards, totaling 12 points and adding three rebounds, one assist and one steal. DeAndre Jordan generated a modest six points but did haul in 14 rebounds, dish out three assists and record a steal. The Bulls were led by Jimmy Butler, who tallied 16 points, six assists, four rebounds and three steals. Robin Lopez generated 12 points, six rebounds and two assists. Bobby Portis scored 11 points and brought down seven rebounds. Dwyane Wade totaled 10 points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal. Paul Zipser paced the second unit with 10 points and two rebounds.
