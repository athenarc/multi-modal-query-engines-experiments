Injuries have led to Dion Waiters playing a much bigger role in Miami to start the season than the team originally planned, and while he's already had five double - digit scoring performances, his efficiency has been subpar. His performance Tuesday night was yet another example, as Waiters shot just 5 - of - 18 from the field (28 percent). That marks the seventh time this season where the shooting guard has shot under 33 percent from the field, and he is shooting a horrid 31 percent overall. On the other side of the ball, Hawks shooting guard Tim Hardaway Jr. has seen a small reemergence in his fourth NBA season, as the former Michigan star's 15 points on Tuesday marked the fourth time he's reached that total this season. He scored 15 points just four times all of last season, but has now become a crucial part of the Atlanta bench, averaging 13 points per game so far.
