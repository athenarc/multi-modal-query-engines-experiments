The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Dallas Mavericks 121 - 118 Wednesday at Smoothie King Center. After missing the last two games with an ankle sprain, DeMarcus Cousins returned in a dominant fashion, as the tandem of he and Anthony Davis were nearly unstoppable in the Pelicans' (31 - 43) victory Wednesday night. Cousins scored 29 points and grabbed a game - high 16 rebounds while Davis still managed to score a game - high 30 points and grab 13 rebounds of his own. Together, the duo shot 50 percent from the field and an impressive 18 - of - 20 (90 percent) from the free throw line. As a team, New Orleans shot 51 percent from the field and a 40 percent from behind the arc, and they needed every one of those shots to fall as the Mavericks (31 - 43) simply would n't go away. Five different Dallas players scored in double figures in the losing effort, with Dirk Nowitzki leading the way with 23 points on 7 - of - 14 shooting and seven rebounds in 31 minutes. And overall, it was actually a very impressive offensive performance for the Mavericks, as the team shot 48 percent from the field and a scorching 52 percent from behind the arc. In the end, however, the team was just unable to overcome the 12 - point lead the Pelicans took into halftime of Wednesday's contest. Up next, the Pelicans will remain home Friday to take on the Kings, while the Mavericks will head to Memphis on Friday to play the Grizzlies.
