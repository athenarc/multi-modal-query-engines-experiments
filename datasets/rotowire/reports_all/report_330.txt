In their first of two matchups against the Boston Celtics (1 - 2) this season, the San Antonio Spurs prevailed with a 95 - 87 win in Boston. First-year Spur LaMarcus Aldridge led the charge with 24 points, 12 rebounds, and five assists. The All-Star forward took advantage of the weak play of the Celtics' big men, also tallying a block and a steal in 35 minutes of play. The game was a bounceback for Aldridge, who posted scoring totals of 11 and 10 in his first two games. San Antonio's froncourt was also bolstered by the performance of 24 - year - old forward Kawhi Leonard, who totaled 19 points and five rebounds to go along with a pair of steals and a block. Despite falling behind early, Boston was able to remain within reach throughout the game, due largely to the performances of a number of bench players. Backup big men Amir Johnson and Jared Sullinger provided a spark of the bench, recording ten points apiece. While sixth man Isaiah Thomas struggled with his shot, he was still able to contribute as a distributor, notching five assists in the game. The team as a whole had issues with efficiency, as they shot just 36 percent from the field through four quarters. Despite their rough shooting night, sophomore guard Marcus Smart proved a diamond in the rough for Boston, posting 17 points and showing off his highly - touted defense with four steals. The Spurs will look to carry the momentum from this game into Monday, as they take on the Knicks in New York. Boston, meanwhile, will enjoy two days of rest before taking to the road against Indiana on Wednesday.
