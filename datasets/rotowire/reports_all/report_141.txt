The Los Angeles Clippers (32 - 16) defeated the Chicago Bulls (26 - 20) 120 - 93 on Sunday. The score would indicate a lopsided game, but it was close until the second half. The Clippers outscored the Bulls by 23 over the final 24 minutes and much of that has to be attributed to the lights - out shooting. The Clippers went 17 - for - 32 from three - point range and shot 54 percent from the field in the win. The bench production was huge as well, as Los Angeles got 58 bench points to Chicago's 18. The Bulls went scoreless for the last five minutes of the game and that was indicative of their recent form. Chicago has now lost eight of their last 12 games and a performance like this doesnâ€™t bode well for the future. Derrick Rose had a nice game though, as he tallied 20 points, five rebounds and four assists in the defeat. Pau Gasol was also efficient, as he amassed 15 points, 14 rebounds and five assists in under 30 minutes of action. The Bulls will have to hop on a plane and play on Monday, as they take on the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City in their next game. The Clippers played one of their best team performances of the season here, as they recorded 26 assists en route to a 27 - point blowout. The star of the show was Jamal Crawford, as he scored 26 points off the bench, while putting the game out of hand in the fourth quarter with 10 - straight points. DeAndre Jordan was fantastic as well, as he accumulated 17 points, 20 rebounds, four assists and four blocks in a dominating performance. Up next is another winnable game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday.
