The Brooklyn Nets (37 - 42) defeated the Washington Wizards (45 - 34) 117 - 80 on Friday in Brooklyn. The Nets seized control of this game from the very start, opening up a 31 - 14 lead after the first quarter. They also ended the contest on a very strong note, winning the fourth quarter 42 - 18. Brook Lopez once again led the way for the Nets, as he continues to play his best basketball of the season. He had 26 points (12 - 22 FG) and nine rebounds, and in his last five games is averaging 25 points and 10 rebounds in his last five games. Bojan Bogdonavic was not far behind, scoring 22 points (7 - 12 FG, 6 - 6 3Pt) in 30 minutes off the bench. Jarrett Jack (14) and Thaddeus Young (10) were the only other Brooklyn players to score in double figures, and while he did not reach double figure scoring, Deron Williams still put together a solid stat line of nine points (3 - 11 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt), nine assists and seven rebounds in 31 minutes. The win, along with a Celtics win, leaves the Nets in a tie for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, but they are losing the tiebreaker to Boston. They currently hold a 2 - game lead over the Pacers for that position with just three games left to play in the regular season. The Wizards rested John Wall for the second night in a row, as they do not have much to play for as the season winds down. Bradley Beal played well in the losing effort, scoring a team - high 24 points (10 - 19 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt), while Marcin Gortat recorded a monster double - double of 21 points (9 - 11 FG) and 16 rebounds. Ramon Sessions filled in for Wall once again, but struggled shooting the ball, going 1 - for - 7 from the field for two points to go along with 10 assists and seven rebounds. Even with the loss, Washington is sitting comfortably in fifth place in the East, and since they are unable to move up or down in the standings regardless of the outcomes for these final three games in the regular season. Up next, the Nets will head to Milwaukee Sunday to take on the Bucks, while the Wizards head home Sunday and play the East-leading Hawks.
