The Memphis Grizzlies (10) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (0 - 1) 105 - 101 Wednesday at the FedExForum in Memphis. It was n't the cleanest game ever played, with the Timberwolves handing out 23 turnovers and the Grizzlies racking up 17 of their own, but it was still a tight matchup that ended with a close finish. Marc Gasol put the Grizzlies on his back and helped the Grizzlies get their first victory of the year. Gasol finished the game with 32 points (12 - 17 FG), nine rebounds, three assists, two steals, and two blocked shots, getting a little bit of everything on the stat sheet Wednesday. Not far behind was Zach Randolph, who had 25 points (12 - 16 FG), 13 rebounds, an assist, and a block. Mike Conley also passed the double - digit benchmark and finished with 16 points to go along with one rebound, six assists, and a steal. The other starting guard, Courtney Lee, shot 5 - for - 11 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from behind the arc to score 14 points in 35 minutes of action. Despite the win, the Grizzlies got little output from their bench unit, who only scored 10 of their 105 total points. With a ton of fresh faces, this was finally a shot for Timberwolves' fans to see their new young lineup. Thaddeus Young was very efficient in his debut, scoring 26 points (10 - 18 FG, 2 - 3 3PT, 4 - 4 FT) and grabbing four rebounds, four assists, and two steals. Mo Williams matched Young's efficiency and added 18 points (6 - 9 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) of his own. Williams also contributed four assists and a steal. No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins made his regular season debut but only had six points, three rebounds, an assist, and two steals, playing just 18 minutes. The Grizzlies' next game is on the road Friday against the Indiana Pacers, while the Timberwolves will take on the Detroit Pistons on Thursday in Detroit.
