The San Antonio Spurs (30 - 6) continued their great play on Monday, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks (14 - 22) 123 - 98. This appeared to be a mismatch on paper and that came to fruition on Monday. The second quarter was when the tides turned, as the Spurs scored 31 points in that 12 - minute stretch while holding the Bucks to just 19. The benches were a big difference as well, as the Spurs reserves scored 56 points to the Bucks 23. San Antonio came into this game as a huge favorite and did what they do. While they didn’t play the elite defense they are known for, they blitzed them with efficient offense and ran away with yet another blowout win. Tony Parker sat out this game, but everyone stepped up in his absence. Kawhi Leonard led the team with 23 points and LaMarcus Aldridge put in an impressive double - double. Tim Duncan was coming off his first scoreless performance in his 19 - year career, to post 14 points, 10 rebounds and four assists in a great all - around game. This team just continues to impress and they'll look to extend their 20 - game winning streak at home on Wednesday against the Utah Jazz in their next fixture. Milwaukee was supposed to have one of the best defenses in the NBA this season, but they continued their poor defense in this game. They allowed at least 29 points in every single quarter and allowed San Antonio to shoot over 55 percent from the field. The bench was especially bad, as no player scored more than five points aside from John Henson who scored just eight. All five starters scored in double - figures, but it simply wasn’t enough against a potent offense like the Spurs. In fact, all five starters tallied at least 11 points, three rebounds and two assists in a great team effort. Milwaukee will have to travel to Chicago for Tuesday’s matchup against the Bulls in a rivalry game.
