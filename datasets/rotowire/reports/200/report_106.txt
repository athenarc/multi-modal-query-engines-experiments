The Dallas Mavericks (42 - 39) secured seventh place in the Western Conference as they defeated the host Utah Jazz (40 - 41) on Monday evening, 101 - 92, at Vivint Smart Home Arena. While securing Dallas' spot in the post - season, this result leaves Utah's status up in the air, as the Jazz are now tied with the Houston Rockets for the final playoff spot in the West. Houston holds the tie - breaker over Utah and therefore, in order for the Jazz to make it into the post - season they will need to win their next game and hope that the Rockets lose their final game. The Mavericks led just about the whole way en route to their eighth win in nine games and fourth straight on the road. Deron Williams led the way for Dallas, with 23 points (9 - 16 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), along with six assists, four rebounds and one steal, in 37 minutes. Dirk Nowitzki was big as he tallied 22 points (7 - 12 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), 11 rebounds, three assists, one steal and one blocked shot, in 32 minutes. Wesley Matthews followed up with 20 points, in 38 minutes. The Mavs shot 44 percent from the field and limited themselves to nine turnovers. The Jazz fought right down to the wire but fell for the third time in a row on their home court. Gordon Hayward poured in a game - high 26 points (11 - 21 FG, 1 - 9 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), along with six rebounds, four assists and one blocked shot, in 40 minutes. Shelvin Mack added 18 points (8 - 14 FG, 2 - 7 3Pt), two rebounds and two assists, while Derrick Favors chipped in 11 points, in 28 minutes off the bench. Favors played limited minutes in his return, after missing one game with a sore knee. The Jazz will look to do their part in securing a post - season berth as they visit Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Wednesday. The Mavericks will finish off their season at home, when they host the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.
