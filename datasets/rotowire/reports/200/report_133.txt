The Golden State Warriors defeated the Orlando Magic 122 - 92 at Oracle Arena on Thursday. The Warriors (53 - 14) bounced back with two straight wins following a three game skid with a rout of the Magic (24 - 45) on Thursday, led by Klay Thompson's hot hand, where he scored 27 points in the first half. Golden State started off on a 21 - 7 run and carried a 20 - points lead into the second quarter. Orlando had no answer for the 58 percent shooting effort put for by the Warriors, and when Thompson cooled off considerably in the second half, Stephen Curry picked right up and started to rack up some points of his own. Thompson finished with 29 points, five assists and four rebounds on 12 - of - 20 shooting, including five three pointers. Curry went on to finish with 25 points, nine assists, one board and three steals, including a highlight reel nutmeg pass to Zaza Pachulia for an exclamation point during the game. Pachulia completed a double - double to the tune of 10 points and 10 rebounds, while Draymond Green rounded out the box score with nine points, 11 rebounds and six assists across 25 minutes. Orlando toyed with a handful of different rotations with 10 players playing at least 17 minutes in the loss. Elfrid Payton led all Magic scorers with 13 points, while Evan Fournier's 12 points and Nikola Vucevic's 10 points were no match for the starters of the Warriors. Jeff Green was the strongest bench player, and added 13 points and four rebounds on 6 - of - 9 shooting across 18 minutes. The Magic shot just 37 percent from the field and 26 percent from behind the arc. Next up, the Magic play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Phoenix Suns on Friday, while the Warriors host the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday.
