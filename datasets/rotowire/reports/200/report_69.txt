The Sacramento Kings (6 - 4) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (5 - 4) 94 - 91 on Saturday. Sacramento lost three straight games coming into their matchup with the Spurs, and it was starting to appear as though their hot start to the season was simply a streak of good luck. However, with a win over the NBA champions, the Kings have shown that they're going to try and earnestly fight for a playoff spot this season. They missed all 12 of their three - point attempts in this game, but the inside work of DeMarcus Cousins, Rudy and Darren Collison was enough to carry the team. Sacramento will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday for their next game. San Antonio saw their three - game win streak come to an end Saturday. If there's a singular reason the Spurs lost, the finger should be pointed at the 16 points they allowed the Kings to score off of 14 turnovers. San Antonio will host the winless Philadelphia 76ers on Monday.
