The Los Angeles Clippers (36 - 19) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (34 - 20) 119 - 115 at the Staples Center. With Blake Griffin sidelined and DeAndre Jordan struggling at the free throw line, Jamal Crawford was the hero for the Clippers on Thursday. Crawford finished with 26 points and five assists in 30 minutes off the bench. It was a back - and - fourth affair throughout, especially in the fourth quarter. The Spurs used the hack - a - Jordan approach on DeAndre Jordan to the tune of Jordan attempting 28 free throws, making only 10 of them. San Antonio is comfortably in playoff position, but missed an opportunity to steal a win on the road to gain ground in the West. Tim Duncan turned in a big performance with 30 points and 11 rebounds and Tony Parker looked good with 21 points and 13 assists. The Spurs have another big test Friday on their nine - game road swing as they will travel to Oakland to take on the Warriors. Los Angeles has now won three straight without Blake Griffin after holding off San Antonio on Thursday. DeAndre Jordan narrowly missed out on another 20 - 20 game as he finished with 26 points and 18 boards. Chris Paul had a big game as well with 22 points and 16 assists over 40 minutes. The Clippers will look to continue their winning streak on Saturday against the Kings.
