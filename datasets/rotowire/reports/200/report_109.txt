Jamal Crawford busted out of his shooting slump after scoring 32 points on 10 - of - 19 from the field in the winning effort.

A pair of 3 - pointers, in addition to a driving, finger roll layup was enough to overtake the lead with just over two minutes remaining in the 4th quarter. Blake Griffin added a clutch jump shot from the free throw line down the stretch and finished with 28 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists in 39 minutes. DeAndre Jordan dominated the glass adding 14 rebounds and 15 points. The Clippers were without point guard Chris Paul (ribs) and looked sloppy on the offensive end at times behind fill in starter, Austin Rivers, who contributed five points and four rebounds. The Magic played a pesky defensive game and saw effective performances from young players Victor Oladipo and Elfrid Payton, as the backcourt finished with a combined 45 points. The Magic were unable to get a good look down the stretch and had no answer for Jamal Crawford’s lights out shooting, even after taking a double digit lead in the 4th quarter. Tobias Harris and Nikola Vucevic added 10 points each, while Channing Frye and Evan Fournier were unable to find a rhythm, finishing with three points and seven points, respectively.
