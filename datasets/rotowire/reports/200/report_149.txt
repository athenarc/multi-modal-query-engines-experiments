The Indiana Pacers (29 - 34) defeated the Orlando Magic (21 - 44) 118 - 86 on Tuesday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. In an all - around dominant performance, the Pacers used a strong second half, where they out - scored the Magic 59 - 39, to finish off the 32 - point victory in front of their home crowd. They shot extremely well in this one, going 53 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three - point line, while the Magic finished at just 37 percent from the floor and a meager 24 percent from deep. With the Pacers hitting 13 more three - pointers than the Magic, they had little to no chance of making a comeback Tuesday. The Pacers got a ridiculous amount of production from their bench, as their bench out - scored the Magics 73 - 18. That effort was led by Rodney Stuckey, who went 13 - for - 19 from the field and 6 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 34 points, while also adding six rebounds and seven assists. It was a new season - high in points for the guard, who's now averaging 19 points and 4 assists over his last six games. Joining Stuckey off the bench was Luis Scola, who recorded 15 points (6 - 8 FG, 3 - 3 FT) and 10 rebounds in just 20 minutes. It marked just his fourth double - double of the season and first since the start of February. He's now averaging 9 points and 6 rebounds on the year. Making just his second career start, Damjan Rudez was forced into the starting lineup, after CJ Miles was a late scratch with a foot injury. He took advantage of the start, hitting nearly everything he shot and finished with 17 points (6 - 8 FG, 5 - 7 3Pt), to go along with five assists. It marked just his sixth time this season reaching double - digit points. George Hill added 13 points (5 - 14 FG, 2 - 8 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and six assists as well. Doing the best he could to keep the Magic close in this game was Tobias Harris, who went off for 22 points (8 - 17 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), six rebounds and two assists in 30 minutes. He's picked his game up of late, and is averaging 21 points and 5 rebounds over his last three games. Victor Oladipo struggled offensively in this one, and scored just 13 points (4 - 12 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), while adding three steals and three blocked shots. He recorded over 20 points in each of his last four games, so it was a disappointing performance for the guard. Rookie Elfrid Payton was in double figures for his third straight game, as he finished with 14 points (5 - 13 FG, 4 - 6 FT), to go along with six assists. Over that three - game stretch, he's averaging 14 points, 6 rebounds and 8 assists, as he's done a little bit of everything for the Magic during that span. Nikola Vucevic chipped in with 13 points (6 - 10 FG, 1 - 2 FT) and five rebounds as well. The Pacers' next game will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday, while the Magic will travel to Milwaukee to play the Bucks on Wednesday.
