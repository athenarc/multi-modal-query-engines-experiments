Orlando and Los Angeles played in a tightly contested game consisting of 25 lead changes, and the Magic ended up needing everyone of them. Orlando won the game 101 - 99 after NIkola Vucevic hit a 20 footer as time expired. Vucevic sat out the previous three games with a bone bruise in his right knee. He did n't start the game as the Magic intended on easing him back into action. HIs knee is seemingly doing much better as he ended up playing 26 minutes and putting up 18 points (9 - 16 FG), five boards, two assists, one block, and one turnover. The Lakers were without Kobe Bryant as they opted to rest him on second half of a double - header. Without him, they spread the ball around, resulting in six players scoring in double figures. Roy Hibert led the way with 15 points, eight rebounds, four assists, and one block in 29 minutes. Los Angeles will look to improve on their 1 - 7 record when they travel to Dallas Friday. Vucevic was n't the only stellar performer coming from Orlando's bench. Due to Victor Oladipo forced to leave the game in the first quarter after suffering a concussion, Shabazz Napier played a season high 30 minutes. He led the team with 22 points (8 - 16 FG, 5 - 9 3PT, and 1 - 1 FT). The Magic welcome the Knicks into Orlando on Saturday.
