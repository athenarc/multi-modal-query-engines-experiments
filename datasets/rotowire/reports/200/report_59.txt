The Charlotte Hornets (39 - 29) picked up a critical road win Thursday against the Miami Heat (39 - 29) at AmericanAirlines Arena, 109 - 106. The Heat controlled this one early, as they jumped out to a 45 - 30 lead halfway through the second quarter. But the Hornets chipped away and were able to pull into halftime with a two - point lead. The Hornets led for much of the second half but the game remained close throughout, as Charlotte never held a lead larger than eight points. The Heat pulled within two points with 5:22 to go and within one on a Dwyane Wade layup with 11 seconds to go. But Wade's three - pointer with 2 seconds went begging, and the Hornets withstood the comeback attempt.

Josh Richardson scored 18 points, the second - highest outcome of his rookie year, on a brilliant 7 - 9 shooting night (3 - 4 3PT). Hassan Whiteside scored 17 points and seven rebounds to round out a solid bench effort from the Heat. They shot a brilliant 53 percent from the floor, but committed 15 turnovers, seven more than Charlotte, and their sloppiness cost them. The Heat next host the Cavaliers on Saturday. The Hornets return home for a Saturday matchup against Denver.
