The Utah Jazz (24 - 35) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (42 - 17) 93 - 82 on Tuesday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis. In a surprise performance, the Jazz were able to take down one of the best teams in their conference, while notching their third straight victory as well. They were the superior shooters in this one, going 45 percent from the field, while the Grizzlies finished at 40 percent. The Jazz also secured a hefty advantage on the boards, as they out - rebounded the Grizzlies 55 - 37, which may have made the biggest difference in their 11 - point win on the road in Memphis. As they've done all season long, Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors did the bulk of the work offensively. Hayward went 9 - for - 19 from the field, but missed all six of his three - point attempts, to finish with 21 points, while adding eight rebounds and six assists as well. He's been absolutely awful from deep over his last five games, going a combined 2 - for - 20 from the three - point line during that stretch, but he was able to overcome the poor shooting and still finish above his season scoring average of 20 points per game. Favors, on the other hand, posted 21 points (8 - 14 FG, 5 - 6 FT) of his own, to go along with six rebounds, two steals and three blocked shots. He's stepped it up offensively of late, averaging 19 points and 9 rebounds over his last four games. He's also posted three blocks in each of his last three games. Notching one of his more impressive lines of his season, Rudy Gobert recorded 15 points (6 - 10 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and 24 reobunds in 36 minutes. He looks to be getting more and more comfortable as a member of the starting lineup, posting a double - double in three of his last four games. The rebounds were a season - high. Coming off the bench, Rodney Hood added 13 points (3 - 5 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) in 14 minutes. Courtney Lee had the strongest performance of all the Grizzlies' starters. He went 7 - for - 13 from the field and 2 - for - 7 from the three - point line to finish with 18 points, while adding five rebounds as well. One of the more inconsistent players on this team, it was one of his better nights, as he averages just 11 points per game on the season. Marc Gasol also did everything he could to keep the Grizzlies in this game, as he recorded 17 points (6 - 15 FG, 5 - 6 FT) and eight rebounds in 34 minutes. He's had a nice stretch of two games, combining for 44 points and 19 rebounds over that span. Mike Conley reached double figures as well, posting 11 points of his own, but he seemed to struggle with his shot, going just 4 - of - 11 from the field and 0 - for - 2 from deep. Coming off the bench, rookie Jordan Adams added 13 points (6 - 8 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt) in 23 minutes. The points were a new season - high for the rookie. The Jazz's next game will be on the road against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday, while the Grizzlies will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Wednesday.
