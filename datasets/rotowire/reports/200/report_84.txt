The Miami Heat (14 - 16) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (17 - 11) 101 - 91 on Thursday. Miami came into the game losing three of their last four games, and with news that Chris Bosh would sit out his seventh straight game on Thursday. Despite this, Miami took control of the game early on, and remained in the lead before Cleveland made a run to take a two point lead in the fourth quarter. However, Miami responded by going on a 12 - 3 run to take the lead and ultimately get the win. Dwyane Wade led his team to the victory with 31 points, five assists and five rebounds in 37 minutes. Miami will play Memphis in the sixth game of their home stand on Saturday. Cleveland had won four of their last five games coming into their matchup with Miami. This was also the first game the team played since receiving news that starting center Anderson Varejao would miss the remainder of the season with a torn Achilles. The Cavaliers' big three combined to score 69 of the team’s 91 points; however, they were left with little production from the rest of the team. LeBron James finished with 30 points, eight assists, and four rebounds in his homecoming, but ultimately it wasn’t enough to get the win. Cleveland will travel to Orlando for the second half of a back - to - back road trip that concludes against the Magic.
