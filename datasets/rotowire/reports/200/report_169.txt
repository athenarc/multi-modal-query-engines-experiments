With Tony Parker battling a foot injury, the Spurs decided to look at rookie Dejounte Murray to take over the starting point guard duties in order to leave Patty Mills in his role off the bench. And in his last four starts in Parker's absence, Murray has already been impressive. Following his performance of 11 points, three rebounds and two assists in Tuesday's victory over the Raptors, Murray is now averaging 13 points, 3 assists and 3 rebounds per game over his last four starts, which included a career - high 24 points in last Thursday's victory over the Nuggets. That is more points and rebounds than Parker's averages this season, and while it is a small sample size, Murray's production at just 20 years old not only gives the Spurs insurance for this year's championship run, but for every one in the future as well.
