The Washington Wizards (13 - 5) easily defeated the Denver Nuggets (9 - 10) 119 - 89 at the Verizon Center on Friday. With the game comfortably in hand, the second seed in the East was able to limit their players' court time, with John Wall leading the team with only 28 minutes played. The 12 assists Wall distributed made it three consecutive games with double - digit helpers. Nene returned to action, after sitting out the previous five games with plantar fasciitis, but was n't immediately inserted into the starting lineup. He scored eight points with eight rebounds in 18 minutes off the bench. Kris Humphries, who started in place of Nene, led the Wizards with 20 points, which came on the back of his 20 - rebound performance Wednesday. Washington was scorching from the field, hitting 53 percent of their field goal attempts, compared with the Nuggets, who could manage just 38 percent conversion. The Wizards travel to Boston to take on the struggling Celtics on Sunday. While John Wall is beginning a nice little streak of double - digit assist games, he's got a while to go before he catches Ty Lawson, who extended his run to seven games with double - digit assists. Lawson added 14 points and three steals to his 10 assists. Wilson Chandler was the only other member of the Nuggets to score in double - digits, dropping 20 points in 25 minutes. Coach Brian Shaw limited Kenneth Faried's minutes yet again, keeping the Team USA member to just 18 minutes. Faried scored nine points with three rebounds in his limited action. Denver will look to reverse their slide Sunday against the Hawks, having lost their last two games.
