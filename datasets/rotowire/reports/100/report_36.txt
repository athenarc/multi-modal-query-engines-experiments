The host Sacramento Kings defeated the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, 116 - 101. All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins paved the way for Sacramento (6 - 9) to earn the easy win, scoring 36 points and pulling down 13 rebounds. Cousins' rebounding effort helped the team establish a 46 - 38 rebounding advantage against the normally tough Thunder. Kings guard Darren Collison added 21 points, but turned the ball over four times while dishing six assists. Cousins, Collison, and forward Rudy Gay each added three three - pointers, contributing to the 12 made by the team on the night. Sacramento reached a .500 record at home with the win. For the Thunder (8 - 8), things are continuing to get worse after the team started a surprising 5 - 1 to open the season. Point guard Russell Westbrook, however, has not seemed to slow down. The NBA's leading scorer scored another 31 points on Wednesday, to go along with 11 rebounds and nine assists. Westbrook's numbers thus far have indicated that he may have a chance at being the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple - double in a season. The Thunder continued to struggle from deep in Tuesday's contest, shooting just 28 percent from beyond the arc. The team hit just seven triples in the contest. The thunder will travel to Denver on Friday, while the Kings will host the Houston Rockets.
