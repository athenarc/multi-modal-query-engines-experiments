Channing Frye's season - high 20 points spearheaded a comeback victory for the Cavs on Sunday, who entered the fourth quarter trailing by one. LeBron James also scored 11 of his 19 points in the final period, while Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving combined for 36 points overall. The Cavs played stifling defense, particularly in the second half, holding the Hornets to 39 points over the final 24 minutes and 38 percent success rates from both the field and three - point range. The Hornets received a typically solid effort from Kemba Walker, who contributed 21 points, and also saw Marvin Williams and Nicolas Batum combine for 31 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist posted an 11 - point, 10 - rebound double - double and Charlotte only turned the ball over five times overall, but found themselves unable to sustain the fourth - quarter advantage.
