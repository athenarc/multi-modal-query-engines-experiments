The host Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 17 - point deficit to beat the New York Knicks on Wednesday, 116 - 105. Oklahoma City (32 - 25) once again saw All-Star Russell Westbrook put the team on his back on Wednesday, as he scored 38 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 12 assists. Westbrook, often criticized for his efficiency, shot 13 - of - 22 from the field and 3 - of - 5 from three - point range. It was also a big night from young guard Victor Oladipo, who scored 21 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting. The team shot a stellar 47 percent from the field and took an edge at the free - throw line and on the glass. The Thunder made 22 free - throws and held a 10 - rebound advantage. The Knicks (23 - 34) have now lost five of their last six games. After taking an early 17 - point lead, the Knicks quickly let their defense fall apart on Wednesday, paving way for Westbrook to produce another signature scoring outburst. Star forward Carmelo Anthony was named an All-Star reserve earlier in the night, and played like an All-Star in the game. Anthony dropped 30 points and came away with four rebounds. However, the Knicks were out - shot, out - rebounded, and got into foul trouble as a team. Both teams will head into the All-Star Break.
