The visiting Dallas Mavericks took down the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, 108 - 104. Dallas (20 - 30) has picked up steam in recent weeks after what was an abysmal start to the season. Friday's victory was marked by a breakout performance from D-League call - up Yogi Ferrell. Ferrell, who shot an astounding 9 - of - 11 from three - point range, scored a career - high 32 points to lead the Mavericks including a game - clinching three - pointer with under 30 seconds remaining. While Ferrell dropped jaws with his impressive play, wing Wesley Matthews also put together a stellar performance, scoring 27 points and coming away with six rebounds. As a whole, the team earned the win on the backs of strong three - point shooting. The Mavs shot an impressive 17 - of - 31 from beyond the arc. Portland (22 - 29), meanwhile, was let down by star point guard Damian Lillard. Lillard shot just 4 - of - 20 on the night in quite possibly his worst outing of the season. On the other hand, wing Evan Turner steped up for one of his best performances as a Blazer. Turner scored 24 points on 10 - of - 17 shooting. The Blazers held a rare advantage in the rebounding column, but were unable to shoot with nearly the efficiency of Dallas, ultimately ending in the loss. The Blazers will visit OKC on Sunday, while the Mavericks will visit Denver on Monday.
