The Detroit Pistons defeated the Chicago Bulls 102 - 91 at the Palace of Auburn Hills on Tuesday. The Pistons (12 - 11), who used a big fourth quarter to pull away from the Bulls (11 - 10) on Tuesday, are now winners of four of their last five games and look to be trending in the right direction with the return of their point guard Reggie Jackson, who played in his second game of the season since returning from a knee injury. Jackson, however, was again placed on a minutes restriction, playing just 18 minutes, but he still managed to record seven points and seven assists in the outing. It was Tobias Harris who led the way for Detroit, recording a game - high 22 points on top of seven assists in 40 minutes, while Andre Drummond posted a double - double of 15 points and 10 rebounds in just 25 minutes. As a team, the Pistons did n't have a great night from the field, shooting just 45 percent, but they did play very efficient basketball, as they dished out 24 assists to just nine total turnovers. For Chicago, they continue to reel, as they have now lost three in a row and four of their last five games. Despite that, Jimmy Butler continues to have a breakout offensive season, as he posted 32 points, six rebounds and four assists in 43 minutes Tuesday and has now scored at least 26 points in four straight games to start the month of December. Beyond Dwyane Wade's 19 points, there were n't any other admirable performances against Detroit, as the rest of the starters combined to score just 29 points, while the bench managed to produce a measly 11 points. As a team, the Bulls made just two of their 15 3 - point attempts and recorded just 15 assists to their 14 turnovers. Up next, the Pistons will travel to Charlotte on Wednesday to take on the Hornets, while the Bulls will look to turn things around Thursday at home against the San Antonio Spurs, who remain a perfect 120 on the road.
