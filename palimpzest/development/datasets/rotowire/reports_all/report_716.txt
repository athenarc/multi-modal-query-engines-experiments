The Atlanta Hawks (61 - 22) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (38 - 45) 99 - 92 on Sunday at Philips Arena in Atlanta in their first matchup of the first round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs. After coming out of the first quarter with a 12 - point lead, the Hawks looked as if they were about to run the Nets right out of the gym and coast to an easy victory. The Nets had something to say about that though, as they eventually went on a nine - point run with eight minutes left in the third quarter to bring it back within three. The Hawks then went on a run of their own, regaining a solid lead over the Nets. The Nets brought it to within four points again with just under two minutes left in the final quarter, but the Hawks proved to be just too much and held on to a seven - point victory despite a strong effort from Brooklyn. The Hawks shot 43 percent from the field and 33 percent from the three - point line, while the Nets went 46 percent from the floor and 25 percent from deep. Kyle Korver had his shot locked in Sunday, helping to be the spark that the Hawks needed to overcome a strong push from the Nets. Korver went 6 - for - 12 from the field and 5 - for - 11 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 21 points, while also adding seven rebounds and three assists. Korver had hit at least three three - pointers in three of his last four games coming into the playoffs, so it was n't surprising to see him light it up from deep again Sunday. Both Jeff Teague and DeMarre Carroll were essential in the win as well though. Carroll finished with 17 points (5 - 12 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT), eight rebounds and three assists, while Teague added 17 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), three assists and a steal. With Korver shooting so well, it really opened up the court for Teague, who was able to drive the ball with plenty of success. The Hawks received a solid contribution from Dennis Schroder off their bench as well. Schroder was able to give Teague a few breaks, while also producing 13 points (5 - 9 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and two assists over 24 minutes. The Nets were able to keep it close due to the performances from both Joe Johnson and Brook Lopez. Johnson was harassed by the Hawks' crowd in his return to Atlanta, but was able to overcome it with 17 points (6 - 17 FG, 0 - 6 3Pt, 5 - 8 FT), six rebounds and six assists. He was n't able to have very much success with his three - point shot, but he was able to do a little bit of everything else for the Nets. Lopez, on the other hand, recorded 17 points (6 - 7 FG, 5 - 6 FT) of his own, to go along with 14 rebounds and two steals. His 14 rebounds helped Brooklyn secure a 47 - 39 rebounding advantage over the Hawks, while the double - double was his second over his last four games. Also notching a double - double was Thaddeus Young, who posted 15 points (7 - 16 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), 10 rebounds and three assists over 39 minutes. The Nets' frontcourt had plenty of success against the Hawks' defense, but they'll need to do even more if they want to have a chance in this series. Both Deron Williams and Jarrett Jack finished in double figures as well. Williams had 13 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and four rebounds, while Jack finished with 13 points (5 - 8 FG, 3 - 3 FT) and two assists. These two teams will play again on Wednesday in the second game of a best - of - seven series.
