The Sacramento Kings (10 - 15) defeated the Houston Rockets (12 - 14) 107 - 97 in a sloppy game on Tuesday. In a battle of two of the worst defenses in the NBA, the offenses played poorly. It's not like the defenses played well either, as Houston shot just 41 percent from the field. Sacramento did shoot 51 percent, but committed an ugly 28 turnovers in the win. There were a combined 30 steals and 49 turnovers in the game and those are not far off from NBA records. The Rockets came into this game in the second half of a back - to - back and they played tired. There were numerous possessions where players were standing around and way too many defensive lapses when there was simply no defense being played at all. The team was outrebounded 47 to 36 and shot just 31 percent from three - point range. Those are indications of a tired team, but the effort simply wasnâ€™t there. James Harden was spectacular yet again though, as he tallied 33 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the defeat. Houston will have a good opportunity to bounce back when they take on the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday in their next game. It's not too often a team commits 28 turnovers and wins, but the Kings managed to pull that off somehow on Tuesday. They played without Rajon Rondo, but all the other starters filled - in nicely in his absence. Darren Collison was the starting point guard for this game and played extremely well, accumulating 14 points, 13 assists and seven rebounds in the win. DeMarcus Cousins also stepped up in Rondo's absence, totaling 26 points and 12 rebounds. Rudy Gay and Omri Casspi also chipped in for some great games, as they combined for 36 points, 19 rebounds, nine assists and eight steals in the victory. This was a great team performance from Sacramento and it's nice to see everyone chipping in without Rondo in the lineup. The Kings have a few days off until their next game, when they take on the struggling Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.
