The Golden State Warriors (54 - 13) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (53 - 15) 114 - 95 on Wednesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland. After suffering a 124 - 116 loss to the Hawks back in February, the Warriors got plenty of revenge Wednesday, finishing with a convincing 19 - point victory over the Hawks. The Hawks winning streak ends at three, but they still sit with a hefty 10 - game lead over the Cavaliers for the top spot in the Eastern Conference standings. The Warriors, on the other hand, have extended their own winning streak to three games, while pushing their Western Conference standings lead to seven and a half games over the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors shot the ball extremely well Wednesday, going 52 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line. Harrison Barnes was unstoppable in this matchup, going 11 - for - 13 from the floor and 2 - for - 3 from deep to score a game - high of 25 points, while also adding four rebounds in 28 minutes. It was a new season - high in points for Barnes, as he's only surpassed the 20 - point mark in two other games this season. The Warriors also saw a strong effort from Andre Iguodala, who came off the bench for 21 points (9 - 12 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six assists and three steals. Like Barnes, Iguodala just could n't miss tonight, as he posted a new season - high in points as well. We ca n't leave out superstar Stephen Curry though, as he posted 16 points (4 - 11 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and 12 assists in 30 minutes. Even without backcourt parnter Klay Thompson (ankle), Curry got some help from the rest of the team, as everyone seemed to step up. Draymond Green added 18 points (6 - 11 FG, 5 - 7 3Pt, 1 - 4 FT) and seven rebounds as well. The Hawks just could n't keep up with the red - hot Warriors. DeMarre Carroll did as much as he could to keep the Hawks close, scoring 16 points (5 - 12 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), to go along with 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. It marked his second straight 16 - point showing, while the double - double was his first since December. Paul Millsap matched Carroll with 16 points (6 - 14 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) of his own while adding nine rebounds and two steals. He's played real well as of late, averaging 19 points and 9 rebounds over his last three games. Jeff Teague and Shelvin Mack were the only other two players in double figures. Teague finished with 12 points (4 - 8 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and three steals, while Mack had 10 points (4 - 8 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three steals off the bench. The Warriors' next game will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday, while the Hawks will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Friday.
