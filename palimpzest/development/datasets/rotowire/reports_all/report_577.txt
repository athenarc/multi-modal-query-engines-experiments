Boston held off Philadelphia's strong start and claimed a resounding 112 - 95 victory in their home opener. The third pick of the 2015 draft, Jahlil Okafor, was the story of the game in his debut. He put up 26 points and seven rebounds on 10 - 16 shooting from the field and 6 - 6 from the line. The rookie also committed eight turnovers. Unfortunately, his effort was n't enough to keep the 76ers in the game. The other bright spot for the 76ers was second year forward Nerlens Noel, who filled up the stat sheet with 14 points, 12 rebounds, two assists, three steals, and two blocks in 35 minutes. Isaiah Canaan also chipped in 18 points and 7 rebounds. Philadelphia will welcome Utah into town Friday, and will look for their first win of the season. Isaiah Thomas led the way for Boston off the bench with 27 points and seven assists in 29 minutes of action. The Celtics front court looks to be a fluid situation to start the season with Tyler Zeller starting but only playing 10 minutes. Jared Sullinger and Amir Johnson played 21 and 20 minutes respectively off the bench, while newly aquired David Lee started and played 22 minutes. Boston will play at home again Friday versus Toronto and look to start the season 20.
