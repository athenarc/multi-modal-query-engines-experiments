The visiting Miami Heat handily defeated the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, 108 - 90. The Heat (25 - 32) entered the All-Star break as one of the league's hottest teams, having won 14 of their last 16 games. Miami added to the wins column again on Friday in what was a well - rounded team effort. Six members of the team scored in double - digits, including 23 for bench guard Tyler Johnson. Another big point of emphasis in the win was rebounding, where the Heat held a big edge. Miami finished the game with a 54 - 45 advantage on the glass. Although the team shot just 40 percent from the field, Miami moved the ball exceptionally well. The Heat notched 30 assists on the night. Atlanta (32 - 25) is in the thick of a tight Eastern Conference playoff race. On Friday, though, the team saw a fairly dismal outcome, as the 18 - point loss came in their first game back from the All-Star break. Though Miami was held to just 40 percent shooting, the Hawks dipped below that total, hitting just 38 percent of their shots from the field. All-Star Paul Millsap had a relatively strong game on the offensive end, scoring 21 points and shooting 6 - of - 9. However, he came away with just four rebounds, contributing heavily to Atlanta's problems on the boards. The Hawks will visit Orlando on Saturday, while Miami will host the Pacers.
