The Miami Heat defeated the host Memphis Grizzlies on Friday, 90 - 81, at FedEx Forum. Miami (5 - 10) has struggled this season after experiencing major roster losses in free agency. On Friday, however, the team was able to put together a strong defensive effort to earn the win. The Heat held the Grizzlies to just 35 percent from the field and only four three - pointers. League-leading shot - blocker Hassan Whiteside blocked another two shots in Friday's win. On offense, meanwhile, young guard Tyler Johnson scored 22 off the bench to lead the team. Johnson was re - signed by the Heat as a restricted free agent after signing a large offer sheet with the Brooklyn Nets this summer. The guard showed his value on Friday, scoring a team - high and also grabbing six rebounds and two steals. Memphis (10 - 6), meanwhile, saw disappointing performances across the board on Friday. Star center Marc Gasol went for just nine points and one rebound on the night. Only two Grizzlies scored in double - digits and the team high was only 16 points. The Grizzlies starting five recorded just 30 points combined. As a whole, the team shot only 35 percent and turned the ball over 17 teams, in what was a bleak offensive showing for a normally high - level team. The two teams will rematch in Miami on Saturday.
