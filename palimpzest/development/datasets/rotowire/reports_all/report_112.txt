Thursday's contest between the Pacers and Timberwolves all came down to whose role players could produce more. With each team's big three having very productive nights, the deciding factor between the two teams ended up being what everyone else could do. For the Pacers, Paul George, Myles Turner and Jeff Teague produced 75 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine combined for 77 points for the Timberwolves, making the trios essentially dead even. And while neither side got anything noteworthy from any other player, be it a starter or a reserve, the ability of Indiana's role players to put up 34 points to Minnesota's 26 gave the game to the Pacers. Additionally, it is worth noting that both teams rank in the bottom - half of the NBA in bench scoring per game, with the Timberwolves ranking dead last.
