The Indiana Pacers (25 - 34) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (13 - 46) 94 - 74 on Sunday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. The Pacers got out to a quick start in this game, grabbing a 59 - 46 lead at half, therefore giving them a comfortable lead for the rest of the game. Along with the hot start, the Pacers were also the superior shooters, going 41 percent from the field, compared to the Sixers who finished at just 35 percent. The Pacers forced the Sixers in 18 turnovers, while committing just 14 of their own, which may have also played a big factor in the win. George Hill had a strong showing on Sunday, finishing with a team - high of 17 points (8 - 16 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 0 - 2 FT), to go along with nine rebounds and four assists. He was coming off a triple - double on Friday, where he recorded 15 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists, so he continued to put up some solid numbers over all three categories in this one. Hill also received some help for Roy Hibbert, who posted 14 points (5 - 12 FG, 4 - 5 FT), 15 rebounds and five blocked shots in 31 minutes. The double - double was his first since the start of February, while he also made a huge impact on the defensive side of the ball, as he continually kept the Sixers out of the lane. The Pacers did see a bunch of production from their bench as well, with both Rodney Stuckey and Luis Scola reaching double figures in points. Scola had 15 points (7 - 12 FG, 1 - 1 FT) and six rebounds, while Stuckey posted 12 points (4 - 13 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), four assists and three steals. Stuckey has had a nice couple of games in a row, combining for 31 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists over his last two. The Sixers really struggled to get it going offensively. Robert Covington had the most production, finishing with 12 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt) and three rebounds. He could've had more, but he had to leave the game late in the third quarter after suffering an elbow contusion. Nerlens Noel also did whatever he could to give the Sixers a boost. In 34 minutes, he recorded 10 points (2 - 8 FG, 6 - 6 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots. The double - double was his second in a row, as he's combined for 24 points and 25 rebounds over that span. He's now averaging 9 points and 7 rebounds on the season. The third member of the starting lineup to reach double figures was Jason Richardson. Richardson finished with 10 points (4 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three reobunds and two steals in 26 minutes. After shooting over 44 percent in each of his last two games, he really struggled this time around, going just 33 percent from the field and a meager 20 percent from beyond the arc. Ish Smith added 11 points (5 - 13 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt), four rebounds and five assists in 24 minutes off the bench. The Pacers' next game will be at home against the Knicks on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Monday.
