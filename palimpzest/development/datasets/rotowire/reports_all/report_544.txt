The Cleveland Cavaliers (44 - 26) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (27 - 39) 117 - 92 on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. In securing this win, the Cavaliers continue to keep a strong hold on the second projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings, with both the Toronto Raptors and Chicago Bulls trailing them by two games or more. The Hawks still own a 10 and a half game lead for the top overall spot, so it remains unlikely the Cavaliers can make up that gap in time for the playoffs. This marks a tough loss for the Nets, as it pushes them to three games behind the Miami Heat for the final projected playoff seed in the East. The Cavaliers shot really well in this game, going 55 percent from the field and 52 percent from the three - point line, while having seven players reach double figures in points. J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov led the team in scoring. Mozgov finished with 17 points (7 - 8 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and three rebounds in just 16 minutes, while Smith posted 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 5 - 10 3Pt) and two assists over 27 minutes. Mozgov has picked his game up of late and is averaging 13 points and 4 rebounds over his last five games. LeBron James also got into the action and finished with 16 points (5 - 13 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and seven assists. James had scored over 20 points in each of his last four games, but he did n't need to Wednesday, as everyone seemed to play well offensively and put up some points. Both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love chipped in with double - doubles. Irving recorded 12 points (5 - 10 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and 10 assists, while Love had 10 points (4 - 9 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT) and 11 rebounds. Despite suffering the loss, Deron Williams posted a solid all - around game. In 28 minutes, he scored a team - high of 20 points (7 - 15 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT), while also adding six assists and two rebounds. He's been pretty inconsistent lately, but is averaging 10 points, 3 rebounds, 5 assists and 1 steals over his last five games. The Nets also saw some solid contributions from their bench. Center Mason Plumlee went a perfect 3 - for - 3 from the field, while going just 4 - for - 8 from the free throw line to score 10 points to go along with five rebounds in just 24 minutes. He has n't produced much offensively since losing a large portion of his playing time to Brook Lopez, as this was just the first time in his last six games that he reached double figures in points. Both Bojan Bogdanovic and Jarrett Jack played well off the bench and finished with 12 and 11 points respectively. The Cavaliers' next game will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Friday, while the Nets will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.
