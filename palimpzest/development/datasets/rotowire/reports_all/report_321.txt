The Oklahoma City (28 - 12) defeated the Dallas Mavericks' (22 - 18) benchwarmers 108 - 89 on Wednesday. The Thunder came into this game as huge favorites as Dallas rested all five starters after an overtime game on Tuesday. That left the Mavericks extremely shorthanded and they simply couldnâ€™t score enough to keep pace with the Thunder. They trailed by 23 points at the half and it never got much closer after that. Oklahoma City is one of the best rebounding teams in the NBA and that was the difference here, as the Thunder pulled down 54 boards to the Mavericks' 41. Dallas essentially decided to sacrifice a game to give their veterans a day off. The team really struggled with its long distance shooting, going 6 for 31 from three - point range. J.J. Barea carried the load in the loss, as he finished with 18 points and six assists. The candidate for surprise line of the night was Salah Mejri, who tallied 17 points and nine rebounds, which both surpassed his season totals in those statistics. Look for all the regulars to be back on Friday for their next game against the Chicago Bulls. The Thunder were expected to dominate here and they took care of business. If there was one blemish here, it would be that Russell Westbrook was ejected in the second quarter for accumulating two technical fouls. He failed to score for only the second time in his career. Kevin Durant stepped up his game in Westbrook's absence, though, scoring 29 points while snatching down 10 rebounds. Serge Ibaka also had a nice 20 - point, 11 - rebound double - double as well. The Thunder will be big favorites in their next game as well when they play host to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday.
