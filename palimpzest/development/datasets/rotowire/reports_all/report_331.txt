The Clippers have been dominating with defense, but the offense was on display here. Not only did they shoot over 52 percent from the field, they had all five starters score at least 15 points. The Los Angeles starters outscored the Minnesota starters 90 - 74. Despite the Timberwolves dominating the points in the paint, 56 - 38, the Clippers dominated at the free - throw line and from the field. Blake Griffin is quietly having an MVP-type season, as his 20 points, 11 rebounds and four assists are almost identical to his season averages. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute is mainly a starter for defensive purposes, but when he scores 15 points like he did here, that's an added bonus. Ricky Rubio made his return from a five - game absence due to an elbow injury, to accrue seven points, six rebounds and six assists in the defeat.
