The Golden State Warriors (20) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (0 - 2) 97 - 87 on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland in game two of their first round matchup of the Western Conference playoffs. The Pelicans got off to a really quick start in this game, out - scoring the Warriors 28 - 17 in the first quarter, as both Anthony Davis and Eric Gordon finished the quarter in double figures. The Warriors then got a huge spark off the bench in the second quarter from Leandro Barbosa, who scored 10 of his 12 points during that span, helping get the Warriors to a three - point lead at the break. After a tight third quarter, the Warriors finally broke out in the fourth, as Klay Thompson got hot and scored 14 points in the final quarter to help push the Warriors to the 10 - point win and give them the two game advantage in the series. Including scoring 14 in the fourth quarter, Klay Thompson finished the game with a team - high of 26 points, as he shot 11 - for - 17 from the field and 3 - for - 9 from deep. With Curry playing so well early on, Thompson did n't have to do much in the first half, but he really turned it on near the end of the game with a clutch performance in front of an electrifying crowd at Oracle Arena. Curry, on the other hand, posted 22 points (9 - 21 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), four rebounds and six assists over 37 minutes. He did n't score at all in the fourth quarter, but he did n't need to with Thompson's emergence. Another player that came up huge for the Warriors was Draymond Green, who time after time made the big play to get the Warriors their momentum back. He notched a double - double and did a little bit of everything in the win, finishing with 14 points (4 - 12 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT), 12 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocked shots. Andrew Bogut chipped in with 14 rebounds as well, helping give the Warriors a 49 - 42 rebounding advantage. Along with helping the Pelicans get the strong start, both Davis and Gordon ended up as the team leaders in scoring. Davis recorded 26 points (9 - 22 FG, 8 - 8 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots, while Gordon added 23 points (9 - 19 FG, 5 - 10 3Pt) and two assists. Davis was having his way with the Warriors' frontcourt early, but they stepped it up in the second half and held him in check. After feeling a pop in his left knee during game one of this series on Saturday, Tyreke Evans had to leave that game and he never returned. Evans was back in the lineup Monday though and the injury did n't look to hold him back, as he finished with 16 points (4 - 13 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 7 - 12 FT), 10 rebounds and seven assists in a near triple - double effort. If the Pelicans want to get over the hump and come out with a victory in this series, Evans will need to step it up even more in game three. Norris Cole provided a nice contribution off the bench as well, scoring 11 points (5 - 11 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 0 - 1 FT) in 27 minutes. Cole was really the only bench production for the Pelicans though, as the Warriors' bench was much more effective Monday. These two teams will now head to New Orleans to play game three of the series on Thursday.
