The Dallas Mavericks (35 - 35) steamrolled the Portland Trailblazers (36 - 35) in the overtime period on Sunday, leading to a 132 - 120 win. Dallas veteran Dirk Nowitzki led the game with 40 points. It was a new season high for the Dallas legend, whose 40 points led play - by - play commentator Mark Followill to proclaim "he still is and always will be Dirk Nowitzki." The sixth - leading scorer of all time tacked on yet another big performance to a list of many, going 16 - for - 26 from the field with three three - pointers. The team as a whole shot a stunning 55 percent from the field including 15 - for - 25 from three - point territory. In addition to Nowitzki's vintage performance, point guard Deron Williams boasted an impressive stat line of 31 points and 16 assists. The second unit kept things going for the Mavs, with center Salah Mejri dominating for 13 points, 14 rebounds, and a whopping six blocks. Dallas's hopes for a higher seed will remain alive after Sunday's contest, as the team remains in a tight race between the sixth, seventh, and eighth place teams in the West. Portland also saw an impressive performance from a big man, as center Mason Plumlee pulled down a massive 19 rebounds. The young Duke alum was simply unstoppable on the boards, pulling down 10 rebounds on the offensive end alone. The star backcourt of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum had a typical strong showing, scoring 26 and 22 respectively. The team had a poor shooting night on the whole, however, going just 40 percent from the floor. The two teams will meet again on Wednesday in what should be an important matchup for the Western Conference playoff picture.
