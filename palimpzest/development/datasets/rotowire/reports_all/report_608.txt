The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 102 - 86, at AT & T Center on Thursday. Philadelphis have been one of the worst teams in the league with Joel Embiid off the floor and that was the case yet again here. San Antonio really turned things on in the second half, outscoring Philadelphia, 54 - 33. Defense was key for the Spurs, as they held the Sixers to 34 percent from the field and forced them to commit 23 turnovers. Rebounding was a huge factor as well, with San Antonio winning that battle, 57 - 48. The Sixers (38 - 11) had to play this game without Embiid and that's simply too big of a loss to overcome. Ersan Ilyasova carried the load in his absence, as he led the team with 25 points, 10 rebounds and four steals. Dario Saric was second on the team with 14 points and nine rebounds, but did commit seven turnovers in the defeat. Jahlil Okafor got the start for Embiid and totaled nine points, nine rebounds and three assists. The Spurs (18 - 31) were heavy favorites in this matchup and they did n't disappoint with this dominating win. Kawhi Leonard led the team in scoring, tallying 19 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. Dewayne Dedmon started for LaMarcus Aldridge and recorded a 13 - point, 10 - rebound double - double.

San Antonio brought eight players off the bench in their win, as they combined for 45 points and 26 rebounds.
