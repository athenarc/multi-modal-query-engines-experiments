The host Oklahoma City Thunder beat the visiting Miami Heat, 97 - 85, on Monday. The Thunder (6 - 1) now sit atop the Western Conference as they continue their scorching - hot start to the season. Despite preseason projections expecting a major drop - off for OKC following Kevin Durant's signing with the rival Golden State Warriors, the Thunder have looked dominant through the first two weeks of the season. On Monday, the team continued the trend, getting off to a quick start with a 39 - point first quarter. While Miami was able to whittle the double - digit lead down a bit, OKC came out even stronger in the third quarter, going on a 200 run to take control of the game. All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook scored or assisted on all 20 points during the run. The Heat (2 - 4), meanwhile, are playing more or less as projected, holding a sub - .500 record following the departure of Dwyane Wade and the likely end of Chris Bosh's playing career. Miami's starting five struggled badly, combining for just 35 points on the night. Center Hassan Whiteside scored just five points, though he did manage a team - high 12 rebounds. Rebounding was not enough, however, as the team fell flat on the offensive end, shooting just 36 percent from the field. The Thunder will host the Raptors on Thursday, while the Heat will return to Miami to host the Bulls on Friday.
