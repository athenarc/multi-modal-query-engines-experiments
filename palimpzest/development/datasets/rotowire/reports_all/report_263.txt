The Atlanta Hawks (13 - 9) protected their home court, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers (3 - 16) by a score of 100 - 87 on Friday night. The Hawks led the whole way in this one, holding the Lakers to only 37 percent shooting from the field, while shooting 50 percent themselves. Atlanta played a good team game as usual, passing and moving the ball with purpose. They had five players score in double digits and nine players score six or more points. Big Al Horford led the Hawks in scoring, rebounding and tied Jeff Teague for team leader in assists, proving that he can do it all. Horford finished with 16 points on 6 - 11 shooting, nine rebounds, five assists and one block. Paul Millsap posted a solid 15 points, eight rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks. Kent Bazemore chipped in 15 points, three rebounds, four steals and two assists, in 25 minutes off the bench. Although the Lakers shot poorly over all from the field, they did shoot an impressive 13 - 27 from deep. D'Angelo Russell posted a nice double - double with 16 points and 10 rebounds, however he tallied a problematic seven turn - overs. Lou Williams led the Lakers in scoring with 18 points on 6 - 13 shooting, in 30 minutes off the bench. Kobe Bryant was not as effective as he was the other night against Washington, this time finishing with 14 points on 4 - 19 shooting, along with five assists, three rebounds, two steals and two blocked shots. Next up for L.A. is match in Detroit on Sunday, which will be the fourth of an eight game road trip. Atlanta has a long break before they play in Dallas next Wednesday, December 9th.
