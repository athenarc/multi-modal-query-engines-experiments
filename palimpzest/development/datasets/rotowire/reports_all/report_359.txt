The Pistons (1 - 3) earned their first win of the season, knocking off the Knicks (2 - 3) 98 - 95 Wednesday night. Detroit, which shot just 37 percent from the field, was led by 23 points and a season - high 18 boards from Greg Monroe, who started at power forward and played 36 minutes. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 20 points, including four three - pointers, and D.J. Augustin added 12 off the bench. Josh Smith struggled mightily from the field, connecting on only 2 - of - 17 shot attempts, only one of which came from beyond the arc. Andre Drummond battled foul trouble throughout the game but still managed to post seven points and 13 rebounds in 29 minutes. The Knicks, who have now dropped two in a row after beating Cleveland and Charlotte, shot it well from three (45 percent) but relied heavily on jumpshots, attempting just 10 free throws, compared to Detroitâ€™s 33. On a night when Carmelo Anthony shot a paltry 5 - of - 21 from the field, second - year guard Tim Hardaway, Jr. led the way for New York, scoring 20 points (8 - 15 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt) off the bench. Jason Smith chipped in 17 points, while Iman Shumpert added 15 (5 - 13 FG) to go with six boards and five assists. Detroit held a double - digit lead entering the fourth quarter, but the Knicks slowly clawed their way back with a mid - quarter run spurred by Hardaway and Amare Stoudemire. A layup from Anthony cut the lead to just five with a 1:5 to play, but Detroit was able to get to the line and hold on, despite missing five free throws in the final minute. Up next, the Pistons host the Bucks at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Friday. The Knicks return to New York to face the Nets at the Barclays center Friday.
