The Thunder (18 - 19) held on to knock off the Jazz (13 - 24) behind 32 points from Kevin Durant on Friday. Oklahoma City trailed by as much as seven midway through the fourth quarter, but Durant and Westbrook stepped up down the stretch, scoring eight straight points in less than two minutes to put the Thunder up 92 - 90 with 2:54 to play. Following a Derrick Favors free throw, Westbrook fed Dion Waiters for a dunk to bring the Oklahoma City lead to three. Then, with the Thunder leading by one with 23 seconds to play, Durant found Waiters for a three - pointer that would prove to be the dagger. In his second game with the Thunder, Waiters finished with 15 points and four steals in 27 minutes off the bench. Westbrook had 25 points and 12 assists, and Durant poured in 32 points to go with six assists and five boards. Serge Ibaka was the only other Thunder player in double - figures, finishing with 12 points in 32 minutes. Utah was paced by 27 points from Gordon Hayward and 20 from Trey Burke. Favors added 22 points to go with 11 rebounds, and Trevor Booker chipped in eight points and nine rebounds off the bench. Rudy Gobert, who continues to start in place of the injured Enes Kanter, scored just four points but had seven rebounds and seven blocks. Gobert now has 25 blocks over his last five games. Up next, the Jazz continue their road swing in Houston on Saturday. Oklahoma City receives an extended break and will not play until Thursday, also in Houston.
