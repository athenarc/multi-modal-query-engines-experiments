At 31 years old, Chris Paul is beginning to make a case for this as the best season of his career. Heading into Monday's matchup against Brooklyn, Paul was shooting a career - high 45 percent on three - point attempts, averaging a league - best 3 steals per game, and turning the ball over less than twice per game. In just 25 minutes on the floor Monday, Paul was able to improve all of those figures, going 4 - of - 6 from three and 8 - of - 11 overall, grabbing five steals, and turning the ball over just once. On top of that, Paul scored a team - high 21 points and dished out nine assists. It was another solid outing for the Clippers' Blake Griffin as well, as the forward scored 20 points while grabbing six rebounds and recording six assists. On the opposing side, Nets' guard Bojan Bogdanovic stepped into a leading role for the shorthanded Nets' offense. Bogdanovic led the team with 18 points on 8 - of - 11 shooting. Former No. 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett did not enjoy the same success, however, as he shot just 2 - of - 8 from the field.
