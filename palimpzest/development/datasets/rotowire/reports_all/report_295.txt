With LeBron James and J.R. Smith both missing Wednesday's game for rest, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love took on even more offensive responsibility than usual. They combined for 51 points, which included Love's 27 - point, 16 - rebound double - double, but it was n't enough to overcome a lack of production from the rest of the roster. Richard Jefferson and Iman Shumpert, the respective replacements for the idle starters, could only muster a combined nine points on 3 - of - 12 shooting, and the Cavs did n't receive any other double - digit scoring efforts besides those of the aforementioned superstars. The Pacers' effort sharply contrasted from Cleveland's, as they saw four - fifths of their first unit hit double digits in the scoring column. Paul George led the way with a 21 - point, 11 - rebound double - double, and Jeff Teague, Myles Turner and Thaddeus Young contributed another 48 points combined.
