The Philadelphia 76ers (9 - 56) came one step closer to reaching double - digit wins for the season on Friday night, beating the Eastern Conference's 14th - ranked team, the Brooklyn Nets (18 - 47), 95 - 89. The Sixers learned this afternoon that standout rookie Jahlil Okafor will likely miss the remainder of the season due to a torn right meniscus. This was a crushing blow for the already struggling team, as Okafor had been the team's leading scorer up until this point. His absence did not seem to present too much of an issue, however, as it gave sophomore big man Nerlens Noel the chance to take the reigns. Noel stuffed the stat sheet for 13 points, 11 rebounds, three blocks, and two steals. Point guard Ish Smith also impressed, approaching a triple - double with 10 points, seven rebounds, and nine assists. The Nets continued to rely heavily on stars Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young, who scored 24 and 21 points respectively. Young also pulled down nine rebounds and Lopez had three blocks in what was a solid showing for the powerhouse frontcourt. The rest of the team, however, has suffered largely from injuries and lack of veteran experience throughout the season, and it showed on Friday. The Brooklyn bench went a combined 5 - for - 20 from the field with multiple players scoring no points in over 10 minutes played. The team as a whole shot just 38 percent from the floor, as they could not seem to find the basket whatsoever. Philadelphia will take on Detroit on Sunday for the second half of a back - to - back. The Nets, meanwhile, will see Milwaukee on Monday.
