Joel Embiid continues to be the lone bright spot for the one - win Philadelphia 76ers and is putting up terrific numbers during his 24 - minute restriction through 10 games. Embiid's six turnovers should not be of much concern, given his ability to grab 10 rebounds and 13 points in just 23 minutes of action, on top of his 6 - of - 10 shooting. The efficiency down low, defensive prowess (Embiid added two blocks and a steal), in addition to his three point shooting ability, make the Kansas product a matchup nightmare for every power forward or center in the league. The foot does not look to be of any concern so far, and head coach Brett Brown has claimed that the young star could see a minutes increase around Christmas. Seems like a great gift for the potential rookie of the year.
