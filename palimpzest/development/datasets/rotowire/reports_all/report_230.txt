The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Sacramento Kings, 114 - 104, Wednesday at AT & T Center. The Spurs (50 - 13) elected to rest stars Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge for the night, and their impact, or lack thereof, could be felt in the first quarter, as San Antonio fell behind by 22 points after the first 12 minutes of the game and ultimately went into halftime facing a 15 - point deficit. However, the second half was a much different story, as the Spurs ended up winning the second 24 minutes by an astonishing 25 points to bury the visiting Kings (25 - 39). Without the two stars, Manu Ginobili managed to turn back the clock and lead the way scoring for San Antonio, recording 19 points, five assists, four rebounds and three steals in 25 minutes off the bench. Patty Mills shined off the bench as well, recording 17 points and 10 assists in 27 minutes as a reserve. David Lee also took advantage of the extended playing time, recording a double - double of 18 points on 8 - of - 9 shooting and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes as a member of the starting lineup. As for the Kings, Tyreke Evans shined in his first start since being traded, scoring a game - high 26 points on 9 - of - 13 shooting from the field. There were n't many other highlights from what turned out to be a disappointing performance from Sacramento, but rookie big man Skal Labissiere continues to show his potential, as he recorded an efficient 15 points on 7 - of - 10 shooting from the field in 15 minutes off the bench Wednesday. Up next, the Spurs will look to extend their winning streak to 10 games in Oklahoma City on Thursday, while the Kings will look to bounce back and end their six - game losing streak Friday against the Wizards.
