The Milwaukee Bucks (41 - 40) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (18 - 63) 107 - 97 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The Bucks continued to gain some steam as the regular season winds down, notching their third straight victory and finishing the season sweep over the Sixers. They've already locked up the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference standings, so this was another solid momentum builder for the playoffs that start this coming Saturday. The game did get somewhat chippy towards the end though, as both Jerryd Bayless and O.J. Mayo received technical fouls for the Bucks, while Jakaar Sampson picked one up for the Sixers. The Bucks were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line, while the Sixers finished at 40 percent from the floor and just 21 percent from deep. Michael Carter-Williams had another strong showing, finishing with 30 points (11 - 17 FG, 8 - 13 FT), five rebounds, five assists and three steals. Over his last four games, he's averaged 23 points, six assists and 3 steals, so the Bucks would love to see him stay this hot going into their playoff series with either the Toronto Raptors or Chicago Bulls. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a solid overall game as well, recording 12 points (3 - 9 FG, 6 - 10 FT), seven rebounds and three assists over 34 minutes. He'll take season averages of 13 points and 7 rebounds into the Bucks' final matchup on Wednesday. The only other two players to reach double figures in points were Ersan Ilyasova and O.J. Mayo. Ilyasova finished with 13 points (5 - 8 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and three steals, while Mayo posted 13 points (5 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), four rebounds and three steals of his own. The Sixers were led by the duo of Robert Covington and Hollis Thompson. Covington went 6 - for - 13 from the field, but just 1 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 25 points, while also adding seven rebounds and four blocked shots. It was n't all good for the forward though, as he turned the ball over a whopping 10 times. He's played well over these final games other than the turnovers, averaging 24 points over his last three. Thompson, on the other hand, finished with 19 points (7 - 18 FG, 3 - 10 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and four rebounds over 36 minutes. Thompson shot less than 40 percent from the field in three of his last four games coming into this one, so it was a step in the right direction Monday with his performance. Thomas Robinson and Jakaar Sampson finished in double figures off the bench. Robinson posted 12 points (4 - 8 FG, 4 - 6 FT) and six rebounds, while Sampson had 10 points (3 - 8 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and five rebounds. The Bucks' regular season will come to an end at home against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Miami Heat on Wednesday.
