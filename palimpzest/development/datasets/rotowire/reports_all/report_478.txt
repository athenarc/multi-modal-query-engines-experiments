The Atlanta Hawks (6 - 1) outgunned the New Orleans Pelicans (0 - 6) in a high - scoring affair Friday, winning 121 - 115. The Pelicans led 28 - 26 after one quarter, but could n't keep pace the rest of the way. Although they managed to tie it up in the fourth quarter at one point, it was n't enough, as the Hawks notched their sixth straight win. Anthony Davis did everything he could to keep his injury - riddled team from tallying another loss. Davis scored an incredible 43 points on 14 - of - 23 shooting, while making 14 - of - 16 free throws. Davis had 10 rebounds, three assists, four steals and three blocks, to go along with his ample scoring. Eric Gordon played well, shooting 8 - of - 15 and scoring 22 points. Ish Smith has been taking advantage of some extra minutes and contributed eight points, 11 assists, and four rebounds in 34 minutes off the bench. Ryan Anderson chipped in 10 points, five rebounds, four assists, and two blocks in 30 minutes off the bench. The Hawks have not missed a beat after last season's playoff exit and are atop the East once again. Despite losing swingman DeMarre Carroll in the offseason, Kent Bazemore has since stepped in as starting small forward and has been fitting in just fine. Bazemore had 10 points, five rebounds, four assists, three steals, and one block Friday. Atlanta was led in scoring by Kyle Korver with 22 points and a 4 - of - 4 showing from deep, while Paul Millsap had 22 points to go with 11 rebounds. Jeff Teague led the team in assists with seven while scoring 19 points. The Hawks, just like last season, continued to move the ball very well and ended up with an impressive 30 team assists on 41 made field goals. The Hawks get right back to business Saturday, as the Washington Wizards come to town for a division battle. The Pelicans will also be right back in action Saturday when they visit the Dallas Mavericks.
