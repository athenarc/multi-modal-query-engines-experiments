The Miami Heat (24 - 21) picked up an Eastern Conference road win over the Chicago Bulls (25 - 19) on Wednesday night at United Center, 89 - 84. It was a slugfest, as neither team had their jump shots working. The two clubs combined to shoot a brutal 8 - 32 (25 percent) from beyond the three - point line, and both teams finished under 30 percent from downtown. The Heat mustered just 12 points in the third quarter, but on a sluggish offensive night all - around, it was enough to keep them in the game. Heat star Dwayne Wade was one of the few players to score efficiently and the only one to top 20 points, as he poured in 28 on a sharp 11 - 21 shooting night to go with seven rebounds and five assists. Chris Bosh notched 18 points (8 - 16) and seven rebounds, and Justise Winslow stuffed the stat sheet off the bench as he provided eight points (3 - 4 FG), nine rebounds, four assists and two steals. Pau Gasol led the Bulls with a robust 19 - point, 17 - rebound night, his third consecutive double - double since he was held to just one point last Wednesday against Golden State. It was n't enough, however, as Jimmy Butler (13 points, 5 - 15 shooting) was the only other Bulls starter to get into double - digit scoring, and the club shot a brutal 40 percent from the floor. Derrick Rose managed just four points in 13 minutes as he was forced to leave with lower back and hamstring injuries. The Heat continue their road trip Tuesday in Brooklyn. The Bulls head on the road for a Thursday game against the Lakers.
