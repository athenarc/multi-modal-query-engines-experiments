The Knicks dominated the Bucks en route to a 122 - 97 win in Wednesday night's season opener in Milwaukee. All eyes were on fourth overall pick Kristaps Porzingus, who did not disappoint in his NBA regular season debut for the Knicks, scoring 16 points and adding five rebounds. But the most surprising performance for New York came from Derrick Williams. A lottery pick back in 2011, Williams exploded for 24 points on 8 - of - 17 shooting and ripped down seven rebounds in just 21 minutes. The performances of Porzingus and Williams overshadowed the return of Carmelo Anthony. After undergoing knee surgery in February, Anthony missed much of the 2014 - 15 season. He had plenty of time to rehab this offseason, but came out flat in the opener with a minuscule 11 points (4 - 16 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), six rebounds and five assists in 29 minutes. The Knicks bench ended up outscoring the starters 73 - 49. Milwaukee was missing three key players Wednesday; Jabari Parker (knee), Giannis Antetokounmpo (suspension), and O.J. Mayo (hamstring). With much of the core sidelined, the Bucks received big games from both their stars; Greg Monroe and Michael Carter-Williams. Unfortunately they did n't get much help from anyone else. Monroe tallied a double - double in his regular - season debut for Milwaukee, scoring 22 points (7 - 17 FG, 8 - 10 FT) while pulling down 14 rebounds and adding four assists. MCW tacked on 20 points despite struggling from the field, shooting 6 - for - 17. The Knicks will look to improve to 20 Thursday night at Madison Square Garden against the Hawks. Milwaukee will hope to bounce back Friday against the Wizards at home.
