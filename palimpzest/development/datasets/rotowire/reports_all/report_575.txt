The Dallas Mavericks (21 - 10) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (9 - 21) 102 - 98 on Friday. Dallas stopped their two - game losing streak with the win. Rajon Rondo led the way with a game - high 21 points to go with eight rebounds and seven assists in 35 minutes. Six players scored in double figures for Mavericks, including Charlie Villanueva who scored 13 points in 21 minutes off the bench. Dallas is slowly but surely learning how to play with a guard like Rondo, and it's intriguing watching the pass - first point guard score more in the Mavs' system. They'll try to keep the good times rolling when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday. Los Angeles played their third straight game without Kobe Bryant. Bryant continues to sit out due to general soreness as a result of his 36 - year - old body having a lot of NBA miles on it. In two of the games Bryant missed, the Lakers have been competitive while sharing the ball, causing some to question how much Bryant has helped or hurt the team this season by his singular style of play. The Lakers shot just 36 percent from the floor and gave up 19 easy points off turnovers to give away Friday's game. Los Angeles has lost five of their last six games, and they'll try to stop the bleeding when they host the Phoenix Suns on Sunday.
