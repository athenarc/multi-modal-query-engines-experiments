Michael Kidd-Gilchrist poured in a season - high 20 points, grabbed seven rebounds and blocked two shots in just his sixth game back from a shoulder injury that sidelined him to begin the season.

No other starter for the Bulls scored more than 12 points, although Doug McDermott scored 14 points (6 - 11 FG) off the bench and has scored in double - digits in three of the past four games.
