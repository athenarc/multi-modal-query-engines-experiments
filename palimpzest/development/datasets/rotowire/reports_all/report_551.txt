The Chicago Bulls (6 - 2) beat the Detroit Pistons (2 - 5) 102 - 91 on Monday night at the United Center in Chicago. The Bulls are off to an impressive start to 2014, and a large part of that has been due to a major team effort on the offensive end. While Derrick Rose led the team in scoring with 24 points (9 - 20 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT) and seven assists, the Bulls got production from all over. Pau Gasol and Joakim Noah both posted double - doubles, with Gasol putting up 17 points (8 - 17 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) to go with 15 rebounds, four assists, four blocks and one steal. Noah posted 13 points (5 - 13 FG, 3 - 4 FT) with 14 rebounds and six assists. The Bulls look to keep their winning ways rolling as they head to Toronto to take on the Raptors on Thursday night. For the Pistons, they just could n't dig themselves out of a first half hole, and have lost two in a row now. Detroit only played eight players in this game, and while seven of the eight scored at least nine points, no one scored more than 19. Both Josh Smith and Greg Monroe had double - double's, with Smith collecting 11 rebounds, four assists and three blocks. Monroe scored 16 points (8 - 15 FG) to go with 10 rebounds and two assists. The Pistons now look to right the ship as they'll head to Washington to take on the Wizards on Wednesday night.
