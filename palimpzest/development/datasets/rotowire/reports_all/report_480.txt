The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons, 106 - 88, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday. The Thunder (10 - 8) had every reason to be a bit sluggish Saturday, after a marathon 132 - 129 overtime victory over the Nuggets on Friday. However, while they did n't quite put on the offensive display of a night prior, Oklahoma City rode Russell Westbrook's sixth triple - double of the season to another win. The perennial All-Star was only 8 - of - 22 from the floor but still managed 17 points, 15 assists, 13 rebounds, a steal and a block. It was the 44th time in his career that Westbrook had accomplished the feat, tying him with LeBron James. The Thunder's starting five also got some much - needed offensive support from the bench, as they posted a collective 48 points. Tobias Harris spearheaded Detroit (8 - 10) with 21 points, four rebounds, an assist and three steals. Ish Smith posted 14 points, three assists and a rebound. A trio of 10 - point efforts from Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Andre Drummond rounded out the starting five's night. Jon Leuer led the bench with eight points and three rebounds. The Pistons were historically futile from behind the arc, as they managed a minuscule 5 percent success rate (1 - of - 19). Victor Oladipo actually led the Thunder in scoring with 18 points, a total that he supplemented with six rebounds, two assists and a steal. Steven Adams had a near double - double with 16 points, nine boards and a steal. Anthony Morrow was outstanding off the bench with 21 points, a rebound and an assist over 26 minutes. Enes Kanter was also productive in a reserve role with 12 points and three rebounds. The Pistons travel to Charlotte to take on the Hornets on Tuesday, while the Thunder square off with the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Monday evening.
