The Atlanta Hawks (18 - 12) defeated the Portland Trail Blazers (11 - 19) by the score of 106 - 97, Monday night in Georgia. This was set to be a very tough game for the Blazers, as their top two scorers were out with injuries. Damian Lillard aggravated the plantar fasciitis he's been dealing with in his left foot, while C.J. McCollum was out with an ankle sprain. The Trail Blazers jumped to a quick 50 start but Atlanta caught up and took a 9 - 7 lead with about seven minutes left in the first and held on to it the rest of the way. Portland fought back with a 39 point fourth quarter but it was not enough to over come the 19 - point lead that the Blazers had going into the quarter. Atlanta had six players score in double digits and shot a solid 48 percent from the field as a team. Dennis Schroder was the only player to score more than 13 for the Hawks. He finished with 18 points (7 - 10 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt), three assists, one rebound and one steal, in 17 minutes. Jeff Teague struggled shooting (4 - 12 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt) but still finished with 13 points, eight assists, two rebounds and two steals. Thabo Sefolosha chipped in 13 points as well but on much better shooting (5 - 6 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt), along with six rebounds, one assist and one steal. The Hawks have now won four straight. Despite missing their two best scorers, the Trail Blazers still put up 97 points, with five players scoring in double digits and 10 players contributing points. Allen Crabbe led the way in scoring with 19 points (8 - 18 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt), along with four rebounds and two assists. Mason Plumlee finished with a solid double - double including 11 points and 10 rebounds, along with six assists, one steal and one block, in 26 minutes. Tim Frazier, who was last year's D-League Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player, played almost the whole game for Portland, logging 47 minutes and 35 seconds. He finished with 12 points (5 - 15 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt), seven rebounds, seven assists and two steals. The Blazers have now lost four straight. Next up the Trail Blazers will finish up their current five - game road trip with a game in New Orleans on Wednesday. The Hawks will host the Pistons for a good Eastern Conference battle on Wednesday.
