The San Antonio Spurs (55 - 10) defeated the Chicago Bulls (32 - 31) Thursday night to remain undefeated at AT & T Center, 109 - 101. Tony Parker (toe), Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili returned to action for the Spurs after resting in Tuesday's win over the Timberwolves. The trio combined for 31 points, 20 coming from Parker, who also recorded a game - high 12 assists. Kawhi Leonard led all scorers with 29 points, and Lamarcus Aldridge chipped in with a double - double with 26 points and 10 rebounds. The Spurs shot an even 50 percent (38 - 76) from two - point land as the offense was humming once again. The Spurs assisted on 29 of their 44 baskets (66 percent) and turned the ball over just eight times. Derrick Rose (9 - 21 FG) and Pau Gasol (8 - 16 FG) led the Bulls with 21 points each, and Gasol recorded a double - double with 12 rebounds. E'Twaun Moore, starting at shooting guard with Jimmy Butler out with a knee strain, poured in 20 points on 8 - 12 shooting, including 4 - 5 from three - point range. The Bulls shot 11 - 22 from three - point range but committed 21 turnovers, and that sloppiness ended up costing them. The Spurs continue their homestand Saturday against Oklahoma City. The Bulls return home for a Friday matchup against the Heat.
