The Sacramento Kings (32 - 48) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (54 - 26) 114 - 112 on Saturday. Although their postseason hopes have long been crushed, the Kings took on the third - seeded Thunder as if they had something to play for. Kings coach George Karl opted to give Rajon Rondo another night off to rest, bringing Darren Collison into the starting lineup. The veteran guard responded well to the starting opportunity, tallying the team's highest point total. The high - scoring, back - and - forth affair came down to the final seconds, as Rudy Gay was able to sink two free throws after a Serge Ibaka foul with less than a second remaining. On the Thunder's last - gasp possession, Russell Westbrook, who committed a game - high eight turnovers, missed a desperation 52 - foot three - point heave that would have sent the game into overtime. Oklahoma City was led by Kevin Durant's 31 points, which he supplemented with eight assists and six rebounds. Westbrook was next with 24 points, 10 assists, five rebounds and a steal. Ibaka managed 14 points, eight rebounds and two steals. Enes Kanter paced the bench with 11 points, six rebounds and a steal. The Thunder remains atop the Western Conference's Northwest Division, and are in the third seed in the conference as well. They're home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night. Sacramento was paced by Collison's 27 points, eight assists, five rebounds and a steal. Gay was next with 24 points, eight rebounds, three assists, four steals and two blocks. DeMarcus Cousins had a quiet night by his standards, supplying 15 points, seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. Seth Curry paced the bench with 20 points, three assists and two rebounds. The Kings are currently in third place in the Western Conference's Pacific Division. They head to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Monday night.
