The Indiana Pacers (37 - 33) made easy work of the Philadelphia 76ers (9 - 62) Monday night at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, 91 - 75. The Philadelphia offense was anemic all night, and after a pair of 18 - point quarters from the 76ers the Pacers entered the half with a robust 47 - 36 lead. The Pacers offense was hardly electric itself - - Indiana asissted on just 18 made baskets and turned the ball over 12 times - - but the Pacers sank 10 three - pointers, enough to bury Philadelphia. Indiana presented a balanced attack as all five starters finished in double figures. Paul George scored a game - high 15 points on a poor shooting night (4 - 16 FG, 1 - 5 3PT, 6 - 6 FT) but added six rebounds, three assists and two steals. Ian Mahinmi scored an efficient 12 points (6 - 8 FG) and added 10 rebbounds and Monta Ellis scored 13 points (5 - 12 FG, 3 - 7 3PT) and dished a game - high five assists. Hollis Thompson and Isaiah Canaan led the 76ers with 15 points apiece. Jerami Grant was the only other Philadelphia player to get into double digits as he poured in 14 points (6 - 12 FG, 2 - 4 FT). Ish Smith had a poor shooting night as he shot 2 - 15 from the floor, although he did grab a team - high nine rebounds and dish a team - high four assists. Philadelphia shot just 39 percent from the floor and had as many turnovers as assists with 15 each. The 76ers continue their road trip Wednesday against Denver. The Pacers host the Pelicans on Thursday.
