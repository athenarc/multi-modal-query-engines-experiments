The Indiana Pacers (5 - 4) defeated the Boston Celtics (3 - 4) 102 - 91 on Wednesday at the TD Garden in Boston. In a relatively sloppy game with 37 combined turnovers, it was the Pacers who were able to come into Boston and steal an 11 - point victory. They were the superior shooters as a team, going 48 percent from the field and 35 percent from the three - point line, while the Celtics shot just 41 percent from the field and a paltry 17 percent from beyond the arc. With the higher shooting percentages, as well as a 41 - 36 rebounding advantage, the Pacers were able to seal the win. Paul George's re - emergence this season coninued Wednesday with a 26 - point (10 - 22 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT), 10 - rebound performance. George sat out all but six games last season with a broken leg, but is now putting up career numbers to start the year, averaging 24 points, 9 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 steals over 36 minutes per game. The double - double also marked his fifth on the young season already, so George is showing some serious production. C.J. Miles saw extended time with Rodney Stuckey out due to an ankle injury. He took advantage of the extra minutes, scoring 17 points (6 - 10 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), to go along with five rebounds and two steals. In injury related news, the Pacers did see one of their top young prospects leave the game. Rookie Myles Turner suffered a sprained thumb in the first quarter and was forced to sit out the rest of the game. Marcus Smart made his much anticipated return to the court after sitting out the last three games due to a toe injury. Coach Brad Stevens had him come off the bench, where he struggled to just eight points (1 - 6 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 8 FT) and two assists over 21 minutes. Considering Avery Bradley was sidelined with a leg injury as well, Isaiah Thomas and Evan Turner were the make - shift backcourt for the Celtics. They were the most productive players on the court, as Turner finished with 20 points (9 - 13 FG, 2 - 2 FT) and three assists, while Thomas added 14 points (4 - 13 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 5 - 7 FT) and four assists. The 20 points were a season high for Turner, who's now scored in double figures in four straight games. Jared Sullinger chipped in with an 11 - point (5 - 10 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt), 11 - rebound double - double as well. The Pacers' next game will be at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday, while the Celtics will remain at home in a matchup with the Atlanta Hawks on Friday.
