The Utah Jazz (28 - 36) handled to Houston Rockets (43 - 21), 109 - 91, on Thursday at the EnergySolutions Arena. Utah's Rudy Gobert continued to show why the Jazz were comfortable jettisoning Enes Kanter at the trade deadline. The "Stifle Tower" had 19 points to go with 22 rebounds (12 of the offensive variety) and four blocks in just 36 minutes. The Jazz flustered James Harden all night, holding the MVP candidate to just 15 points on 3 of 13 shooting. The Jazz will have a chance to even the season series with the Rockets at two when they square off on the final day of the regular season. Houston was coming off a hard fought loss in Portland on Wednesday and came out flat against Utah. The Rockets were pushed around on the glass as they were out - rebounded by 20 for the second night in a row. The lone bright spot was Corey Brewer, who led the team in scoring for the second straight night, scoring 25 points. The Rockets have a couple days off to recover before finishing up their four - game road trip Sunday against the Clippers. Utah looked completely different Thursday than it did when it struggled to hold off New York on Tuesday. The Jazz held the high flying Rockets to just 43 first - half points and paired that with their highest point total since Jan. 30 against Golden State where they scored 110. Gordon Hayward was back in the fold for the Jazz after being held out of Tuesday's game with back soreness. Hayward shined in his return with 29 points on 10 - of - 17 shooting and Rodney Hood posted a career - high 20 points. The Jazz will look to extend their winning streak to five when they host the Pistons on Saturday.
