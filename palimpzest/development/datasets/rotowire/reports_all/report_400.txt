The Miami Heat (41 - 29) took down the ailing New Orleans Pelicans (26 - 43) at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday, winning 113 - 99. It was a big night for Miami's veteran backcourt, as guards Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic combined for 46 points. Wade led the team in scoring while also pulling down seven rebounds and committing just one turnover in 31 minutes of played. Dragic, meanwhile, added an impressive eight rebounds and five assists on top of his 21 points. The true star, however, was bench big man Hassan Whiteside, who delivered a massive 24 - point, 14 - rebound double - double while also swatting three shots. Miami has continued to climb in the standings despite the absence of All-Star Chris Bosh. The Heat have ascended to third in the East while their star struggles with recurring blood clots. New Orleans, meanwhile, has been dealings with injury issues of its own. The struggling Pelicans took a major blow earlier this weak when it was announced that star forward Anthony Davis would miss the remainder of the 2015 - 16 season. A battered Pelicans team took the floor on Tuesday, with Dante Cunningham getting the nod at power forward. It was a tough night all - around, as the team shot just 39 percent. The injured squad did find a leader in point guard Jrue Holiday, who scored 24 points while recording seven assists and four steals. The Heat will go on to visit San Antonio on Wednesday, while New Orleans will travel to Indiana on Thursday.
