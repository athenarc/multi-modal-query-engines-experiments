The host San Antonio Spurs took down the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, 100 - 99. The Spurs (46 - 13) have won five straight and look poised to make a push for the first seed in the Western Conference after an injury to Golden State's Kevin Durant. On Wednesday, San Antonio saw stellar play from superstar forward Kawhi Leonard. Leonard had a double - double thanks to a team - leading 31 points and 10 rebounds. More importantly, though, Leonard sank the game - winning jumper with 2 seconds remaining in the game to earn the win for his team. He truly put the team on his back, as he was the only Spur to attempt more than nine field goals on the night. He led the team in not only points and rebounds, but steals as well, as he recorded three takeaways on the defensive end. It was a night to remember for the MVP contender and reigning two - time Defensive Player of the Year. Indiana (31 - 30) kept it impressively close with the powerhouse Spurs. Star forward Paul George led the team on offense despite shooting just 5 - of - 18. George had 22 points and went a perfect 10 - of - 10 at the free - throw line. One area that sank the Pacers was three - point shooting, as the team hit only 29 percent of its shots from beyond the arc. It was tough to find an offensive rhythm despite shooting 45 percent overall, as the team hit only 72 percent of its free - throws and struggled from deep. San Antonio will host the Timberwolves on Saturday, while Indiana will enjoy the rest of the week off.
