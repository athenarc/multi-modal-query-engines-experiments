The Dallas Mavericks (47 - 31) defeated the Phoenix Suns (39 - 40) 107 - 104 on Wednesday in Dallas. Dirk Nowitzki led the way for Dallas, scoring 19 points (7 - 15 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt), including the final four for the Mavericks to seal the deal. But, it was Tyson Chandler who had the monster performance Wednesday night, scoring 12 points (5 - 9 FG) and grabbing 23 rebounds in 34 minutes. It was Chandler's first time since early December where he was able to grab 20 - plus rebounds. Monta Ellis scored a game - high 20 points, but it took a 10 - of - 21 shooting effort from the field to reach that mark. Rajon Rondo was the fourth Dallas starter to score in double figures, recording 12 points (6 - 9 FG) and seven assists in 30 minutes. Off the bench, Devin Harris contributed 12 points on 5 - of - 9 shooting, while Amar'e Stoudemire's 10 points round out the six Mavericks who scored in double figures. As a team, Dallas shot just 22 percent from three, but their offense still worked efficiently, as they had 18 assists to just eight turnovers on the night. Even with the win, the Mavericks continue to sit comfortably in seventh place in the Western Conference, and that is likely where they will be once the playoffs begin. With the loss, the Suns were eliminated from playoff contention for the fifth consecutive season. Gerald Green was phenomenal in the losing effort, scoring 30 points (10 - 19 FG, 5 - 10 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) in 30 minutes, but his season - best performance was just not enough. Markieff and Marcus Morris both got the start Wednesday and combined for 31 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists, while Eric Bledsoe played poorly by his standards, posting just 14 points (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt), one rebound and three assists in 33 minutes. T.J. Warren has continued to be solid, as Phoenix has given him more run off the bench as of late. He had 10 points on 4 - of - 9 shooting in 24 minutes off the bench. Up next, the Mavericks will head to Denver to take on the Nuggets Friday, while the Suns will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Friday.
