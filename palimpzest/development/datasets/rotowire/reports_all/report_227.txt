The Brooklyn Nets (5 - 7) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (3 - 11) 94 - 92 on Friday. Brooklyn continues to sputter along. Despite being a veteran - laden team, they've only played so - so to this point. They dropped five straight games coming into Friday and barely got past the injury - depleted Thunder. The Nets continue their three - game road trip in San Antonio on Saturday against the Spurs. Oklahoma City has lost five straight games. Andre Roberson moved back into the starting lineup at shooting guard, pushing Jeremy Lamb back to a bench role. Roberson put up four points in 22 minutes, but his production comes mostly on the defensive end. Lamb played just 17 minutes off the bench. The Thunder will stay home and host the Golden State Warriors on Sunday.
