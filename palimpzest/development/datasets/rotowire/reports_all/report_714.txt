The Cavs lost Kyrie Irving (shoulder) and Iman Shumpert (shoulder) within the game but scored the victory on the strength of Lebron James' 33 - point, 10 - rebound double - double. Defense was also a key, as Utah committed 16 turnovers and shot just 24 percent from long distance. Irving followed James with 21 points over 30 minutes before departing. Kevin Love posted 10 points and nine rebounds over 20 minutes in his return from a 13 - game absence due to a knee injury. Shumpert had nine points and three rebounds in 22 minutes, and J.R. Smith, getting extra run due to Shumpert's early shower, led the bench with 12 points. Rudy Gobert's 20 - point, 19 - rebound double - double led Utah. Gordon Hayward followed with 13 points, while Joe Johnson and Joe Ingles turned in matching 12 - point efforts. George Hill turned in a modest nine points.
