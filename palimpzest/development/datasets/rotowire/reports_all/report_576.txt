The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (0 - 2) 93 - 90 on Thursday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Russell Westbrook left the game in the first quarter with a broken right hand and did not return to the game. It is unclear how long Westbrook will be out with the injury, but some reports suggested he could miss a few as two weeks. With Kevin Durant already sidelined due to foot surgery for at least the first month of the season, the Thunder are in danger of digging a hole to start their season that may be too deep to crawl out of and reach the playoffs in the Western Conference. In addition to Durant, the Thunder are also dealing with injuries to Anthony Morrow, Mitch McGary, Jeremy Lamb, Grant Jerrett, and Reggie Jackson. They may only have eight healthy players for their next game if no one returns to action Saturday against the Denver Nuggets. The Clippers could n't create much separation from Oklahoma City despite all of the injuries the Thunder are dealing with. Spencer Hawes was brought in this offseason to help shore up the Clippers' frontcourt depth by giving them a versatile shooter off the bench. It was expected Hawes might carve out a big enough role to steal some minutes from starters Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, but that was n't the case in the opener as Hawes played just 19 minutes off the bench, while Griffin played 38 and Jordan played 35. The Clippers finish off a back - to - back set to start the season on Friday when they play Lakers.
