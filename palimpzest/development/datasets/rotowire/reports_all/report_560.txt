The San Antonio Spurs (53 - 9) defeated the Sacramento Kings (25 - 36) 104 - 94 at AT & T Center on Saturday. It was mostly smooth sailing for the host Spurs, as they improved their impeccable home record on the season to 300. If not for the Golden State Warriors remarkable run at history, there would be more focus on how Gregg Popovich's squad. San Antonio was led by Kawhi Leonard, who scored 25 points on 24 shots, but rounded out the box score with 13 rebounds and six assists. Manu Ginobli proved to be the needed scoring asset off the bench, and turned back the clock with some vintage euro steps, as he scored 22 points on a lights out 8 - of - 11 shooting. Boris Diaw and David West each pitched in double figures, and the well rounded team needed all the help they could get, as LaMarcus Aldridge (hamstring) and Tim Duncan (rest) did not play. The Spurs depth is one of their biggest strengths, and proved too much to handle for the Kings, who failed to pull the game within striking distance after the second quarter. The Spurs will visit the Indiana Pacers (33 - 30) on Monday. Rebounding proved to be the Kings major shortcoming in the game, as the Spurs dominated the glass 46 - 33. DeMarcus Cousins put forth another dominant effort and contributed 31 points to lead all scorers, to go along with nine rebounds and three assists on 10 - of - 20 shooting. Quincy Acy was a go - to in the Kings gameplan, and his 16 points were above his season average, but when Rudy Gay does not get his shot going, especially in a volume effort, the lack of scoring options tends to make Sacramento's battles an uphill task. Darren Collison added 12 points off the bench, in addition to three rebounds and seven assists on 5 - of - 9 shooting in 33 minutes. The Kings will visit the New Orleans Pelicans (23 - 38) on Monday.
