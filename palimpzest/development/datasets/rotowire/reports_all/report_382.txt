The Minnesota Timberwolves (20) defeated the Denver Nuggets (1 - 1) 95 - 78 Friday. 2015 top overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns’ coming out party spearheaded the Timberwolves to a rousing victory over one of the more potent offenses in the NBA. The standout rookie posted his second double - double in as many games and was dominant on the defensive glass in particular, hauling in 11 of his 14 boards on that end of the floor. Towns’ deft 59 percent shooting (17 - for - 29) over his first two career games has also been an eye - opener. The Wolves also enjoyed a nice rebound effort from Andrew Wiggins, who had struggled mightily with his shot in the opener. Wiggins poured in 18 points to supplement Towns’ outstanding effort, and Zach LaVine and Kevin Martin paced Minnesota’s bench with 10 and 14 points, respectively. The Nuggets could not come close to duplicating their shocking road victory over the Rockets in the opener, enduring mediocre shooting nights from their starting five. First-round pick Emmanuel Mudiay paced Denver with 15 points and did cut down his turnovers to a respectable four after being charged with 11 in the opener. However, reserve Will Barton outscored the rest of the Nuggets’ starters with 14 points over 30 minutes, while the normally prolific Danilo Gallinari could only contribute 10 points on a subpar 4 - of - 13 shooting performance. Overall, Denver was only able to muster a mediocre 31 team field goal percentage in the loss. The victory keeps the Timberwolves perfect at 20 and in first place in the Western Conference’s Northwest Division. They now head to Portland to face the Blazers on Monday. The loss drops the Nuggets to 1 - 1 and places them into a last place tie in the Western Conference’s Northwest Division. They next head to Oklahoma City for a showdown with the Thunder on Sunday.
