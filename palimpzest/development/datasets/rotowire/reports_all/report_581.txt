The Atlanta Hawks (34 - 28) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (12 - 51) 106 - 77 on Friday. In what looked like a lopsided matchup on paper, proved to be one on the court. Atlanta used their defense to pull out the win, as they held the Lakers to 77 points on 34 percent shooting. The fastbreak differential was huge as well, with the Hawks getting 27 fastbreak points to the Lakers two. Despite barely clearing 100 points, Atlanta shot 54 percent from the field in the victory. Atlanta has been one of the best defenses in the league over recent weeks and absolutely shut down the Lakers in this game. No Hawks player played particularly well, but they got some great performances from their bench. Dennis Schroeder led the team with 16 points off the bench and Kris Humphries nearly double - doubled in his Atlanta debut. Kyle Korver was extremely efficient, as he scored 15 points, while going 5 - for - 6 from the field. It's a good thing the starters got a nice rest here, as they play again on Saturday against the Los Angeles Clippers. Los Angeles has been playing more competitively recently, but this was a downright ugly performance. They were without Kobe Bryant, Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson though, so it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. D'Angelo Russell really struggled, as he went 3 - for - 16 from the field after averaging nearly 27 points a game across his last four games. Julius Randle was the only Laker who played well, as he double - doubled in a 16 - point, 10 - rebound game. On deck for the Lakers is a nightmare matchup against the Golden State Warriors on Sunday.
