The Toronto Raptors (17 - 11) defeated the Miami Heat (15 - 10) by a score of 108 - 94, Friday night in Miami. The game was tight in the beginning, with Miami up five going into the half. Toronto came out of the dressing room ready to compete and outscored the Heat 58 - 39 the rest of the way. This was a big win for the Raptors who were coming off losses to two top Eastern teams, Indiana and Charlotte. The Raptors would have been asking questions had they lost this one too, however they managed to snap the Heat's three - game winning streak and get back on track with the W. Toronto shot strong percentages all around, going 51 percent from the field, 81 percent from the free throw line and a better - than - average 38 percent from the beyond the arc. The Raptors also took care of the ball very well, only giving up seven turnovers on the game. DeMar DeRozan made sure his team did not drop three straight by offering up 30 points on strong shooting (10 - 17 FG, 10 - 13 FT). DeRozan also logged four rebounds, four assists and two steals, in a hefty 40 minutes. Kyle Lowry was big as well with 21 points, four assists, three rebounds and four steals, in 37 minutes. Luis Scola chipped in 20 points of his own, on 9 - 16 shooting. Terrence Ross was efficient off the bench with 17 points (6 - 9 FG, 5 - 8 3Pt). DeMarre Carroll remained out with a knee contusion. Miami shot the ball reasonably well but lost the rebounding battle and also gave up six more turnovers than their competition, a combination that will not lead to many wins. Dwyane Wade led the Heat in scoring with 21 points (8 - 16 FG, 5 - 5 FT), along with six assists and four rebounds. Wade however gave up eight turnovers, in 31 minutes. Gerald Green gave the Heat a great spark off the bench, as usual, finishing with 20 points. Green shot a blistering 5 - 10 from beyond the arc and went 7 - 15 over - all from the field. Goran Dragic contributed a healthy 18 points (8 - 13 FG, 2 - 3 FT), five assists and two rebounds in 33 minutes. Josh McRoberts remained out with a sore knee. Next Miami will host the Trail Blazers on Sunday. The Raptors will be back at home to host the Kings on Sunday, after going 1 - 2 on their road trip.
