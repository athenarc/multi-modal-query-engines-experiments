The Washington Wizards (20) defeated the Toronto Raptors (0 - 2), 117 - 106, on Tuesday at the Air Canada Centre. The Wizards are the only team with a road win so far in this year's postseason and now have a commanding 20 lead as the series heads back to Washington for Game 3. Washington's John Wall put together a stellar performance in Game 2 with 26 points and 17 assists. The Raptors trailed by double digits at the half, but cut the Wizards' lead to just two points early in the third quarter. The Wizards responded by outscoring the Raptors 34 - 14 for the rest of the quarter to build a commanding lead. Toronto began to cut into the lead, but had trouble getting stops and were stuck trading baskets with Washington down the stretch. The Wizards have a chance to take a 30 advantage in the series on Friday in front of their home crowd. Washington flipped the script from Game 1's defensive oriented win to light up the scoreboard in Game 2 to the tune of 117 points. The Wizards boosted their field goal percentage from 39 in Game 1 to 53 in Game 2. In addition to Wall's big outing, Bradley Beal was on fire with 28 points on 12 - for - 21 shooting. The Wizards are now positioned to close out this best of game series on their home floor with Games 3 and 4 at the Verizon Center. Toronto will have an uphill climb to get back into this series after dropping its first two games at home. That uphill climb is made tougher by the fact that star point guard Kyle Lowry is clearly less than 100 percent. Lowry finished with six points on 3 - of - 10 shooting in 27 minutes on the floor and did not play in the final 5:56. He appeared to suffer a foot injury in the fourth and was hindered by a number of injuries down over the last month of the regular season. The bright spots for the Raptors were DeMar Derozan and Sixth Man of the Year Louis Williams scoring 20 points apiece. The Raptors now face a must - win game Friday in Washington.
