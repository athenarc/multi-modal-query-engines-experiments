Minnesota's Kevin Martin hit three three - pointers in the fourth quarter to tie the game up at 95 with :43 seconds remaining, but could n't connect on a fourth to send the game to overtime as the Grizzlies narrowly escaped with their 42nd win of the season. Mike Conley canned the go - ahead three with thirty seconds to go. All three contests between these teams this season have been decided by four points or less. Memphis narrowly avoided its second loss in as many nights and third loss in a row overall. Zach Randolph was held in check offensively, scoring just seven points. The rest of the team had an excellent shooting performance, going 59 percent from the field. Memphis will have two days off before hosting Utah on Tuesday. Minnesota once again kept things close against a playoff - calibur team, but was unable to come out on top. The Timberwolves have now dropped two games in a row after losing 96 - 89 on Friday in Chicago. Kevin Garnett was ejected in the third quarter after picking up his second technical foul. The Timberwolves will play their next three games at home, with the next contest coming Monday against the Clippers.
