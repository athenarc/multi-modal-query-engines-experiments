The Hornets (4 - 4) held on to survive the Knicks (4 - 5) by a score of 95 - 93 at Time Warner Cable Arena on Wednesday. With 2 seconds remaining, Cody Zeller made a nice move to get open on the inbounds and flipped the ball home to give the Hornets a two - point lead. The Knicks thought they had the win when rookie Kristaps Porzingus drained a desperation three - pointer with 0 seconds left, but the shot did n't count. Carmelo Anthony had a chance to win the game, but his shot bounced off the side of the backboard and went back to Charlotte. New York blew a 10 - point lead going into the fourth quarter. Anthony finished with a game - high 29 points (12 - 25 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 4 FT) and is slowly creeping his season average back to where he normally is at. Coach Derek Fisher rolled with a deep lineup again as 12 Knicks saw playing time. Despite the blown lead, New York played solid defense for most of the night - - particularly Robin Lopez, who shut down Al Jefferson. Porzingus had a game - high 15 rebounds to go along with 10 points for his fourth double - double of the season. Trailing by 10 going into the final quarter, the Hornets employed two Jeremy's - - Lin and Lamb - - off the bench and the duo was able to drag Charlotte back into the game. Lin scored eight of his 17 points in the fourth outplayed Kemba Walker for a second consecutive game. Walker, who finished with nine points (2 - 11 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), was a bit banged up during one of the final possessions of the game. Nicolas Batum had the best night for Charlotte, posting a team - high 24 points (10 - 18 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 5 FT) while pulling down five rebounds over 36 minutes. The Knicks host LeBron James and the Cavaliers on Friday; the Hornets head to Chicago to take on the Bulls.
