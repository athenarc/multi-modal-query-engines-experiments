The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Orlando Magic, 105 - 99, on Saturday night at Quicken Loans Arena. The Cavs remain undefeated as they held on to avoid a collapse against the feisty Magic. Despite having not won a game yet this season, the Magic fought hard and right down to the wire in this one. Orlando battled back from a 17 - point deficit at halftime to make it a three - point game with about three minutes left but J.R Smith responded with back - to - back three - pointers, to put the Cavs back in control. Cleveland (30) was led by the superstar tandem of LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, who combined for 43 points, on the second night of a back - to - back. Meanwhile, Kevin Love added 19 points and J.R. Smith chipped in 16, while Tristan Thompson took care of business in the paint, hauling in 12 rebounds. The Cavs will have a couple days rest before they are back in action on Tuesday when they host James Harden and the Rockets. The Magic (0 - 3) have had a rough start to their season but that can somewhat be expected of a team that is sporting a new look; while, having to face the defending champs after a couple of tough losses is certainly an extra challenge. Nonetheless, the Magic put up a fight as they battled back to give the Cavs a scare late in the fourth. Evan Fournier led the way for Orlando with 22 points in 37 minutes. The Magic look to nab their first win of the season when they visit Philly to take on the 76ers on Tuesday.
