The Los Angeles Clippers (10) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (0 - 1) 107 - 92 on Sunday night at the Staples Center. in Game 1 of their first round playoff series. It was a game of runs, but the Clippers were able to stay in control for majority of the game because they simply had a response for every run the Spurs were able to go on. It was one of the best performances this Los Angeles team has put together all season, as they dominated a San Antonio team that has been playing its best basketball of the season at the right time. Both Chris Paul and Blake Griffin lead the charge for the Clippers. Paul (13 - 19 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt) recorded a game - high 32 points to go along with six rebounds and six assists in 35 minutes, while Griffin put together a double - double of 26 points (9 - 20 FG, 8 - 10 FT) and 12 rebounds while also adding six assists, three steals and three blocks in 41 minutes. Jamal Crawford was able to do as he usually does and score 17 points (7 - 10 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt) in 23 minutes off the bench while J.J. Reduce was the fourth and final Clipper to score in double figures, finishing with 10. DeAndre Jordan fell one point shy of a double - double, posting nine points and 14 boards in 37 minutes. As a team, Los Angeles shot an impressive 51 percent from the field and 56 percent from behind the arc on a night where it seemed as if anything and everything was dropping for them. For the Spurs, it was a night to forget, as they shot a dreadful 37 percent from the field, 30 percent from three and a horrific 54 percent from the free throw line. Kawhi Leonard led the way scoring for San Antonio, posting 18 points (7 - 12 FG), six rebounds and four steals in a team - high 33 minutes. Four other Spurs scored in double figures, but none of them eclipsed 11, with Tim Duncan and Marco Belinelli each posting 11 points and Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili each scoring 10. For a team that tends to do a good job of spreading the scoring wealth, there was not much scoring to go around Sunday night, and they will have to be much more effective if they wish to even the series. The two teams will next meet on Wednesday in Los Angeles for Game 2.
