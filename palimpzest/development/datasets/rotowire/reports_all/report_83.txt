The Memphis Grizzlies needed their starting point guard, Mike Conley, who got a tremendous payday in the offseason, to flash brilliance on both sides of the floor to secure their fifth straight win. Conley was remarkable in his matchup with the Hornets Kemba Walker, and got the better of the matchup by not only scoring 31 points, but holding Walker to just 17 points on the other end. Conley's final line, in addition to his 30 - plus point performance, included four rebounds, two assists and three steals on 11 - of - 21 shooting. The Hornets bench ended up outplaying the starters, however, they saw a lot of minutes in garbage time in the fourth quarter when the game was already opened up. Frank Kaminsky stood out amongst the rest, as he poured in 23 points on 11 shots in 20 minutes, while Spencer Hawes added 14 points and 10 rebounds.
