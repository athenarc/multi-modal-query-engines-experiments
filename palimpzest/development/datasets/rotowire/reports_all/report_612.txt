The Los Angeles Lakers had an impressive offensive night as they took down the visiting Memphis Grizzlies, 116 - 102, on Tuesday. The Lakers (13 - 25) had 17 three - pointers and 34 assists en route to a double - digit win over the powerhouse Grizzlies. The commanding performance came as a bit of a surprise for the struggling Lakers, as the team had lost 15 of its last 17 games prior to Tuesday's win. Six players scored in double digits for Los Angeles, and the team shot a stellar 51 percent from the field. Guard Nick Young led LA with 20 points, going 6 - of - 11 while attempting shots exclusively from beyond the arc. Second-year forward Julius Randle, however, was the biggest difference - maker. The big man had his second triple - double of the season and the third of his career, as he scored 19 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 11 assists. Memphis (22 - 15) found itself in somewhat of the opposite position of Los Angeles after Tuesday's game. The Grizzlies had been on a roll, having won four of their last six and sitting comfortably in the playoff picture. The team struggled on Tuesday, however, shooting just 39 percent and proving unable to defend against LA's powerful perimeter shooters. Stars Marc Gasol and Mike Conley impressed per usual, scoring 22 and 21 respectively. The rest of Memphis's lineup was less dominant, however, as the remainder of the starting five combined for just 13. The Grizzlies will stay in Los Angeles to face the Clippers on Wednesday, while the Lakers will visit Portland on Thursday.
