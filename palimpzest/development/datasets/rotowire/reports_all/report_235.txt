The Houston Rockets defeated the Golden State Warriors 132 - 127 in double overtime at Oracle Arena on Thursday. The thrilling matchup that took two overtimes was a neck - and - neck affair from end - to - end. The second overtime was sloppy, given the minutes that both teams players were starting to accumulate at that point, however, it was James Harden and his monstrous triple - double that eventually separated the two teams. The fourth quarter came to a close with Kevin Durant on the free throw line, where the former MVP drained both shots to tie the game at 113 points a piece. Klay Thompson extended the first overtime to a second one after burying a 15 - foot jumper on the Andre Iguodala assist with :27 left, but Durant failed to hit the game winner at the end of the first overtime with no time left on the clock. The Warriors (16 - 3) managed only four points in the second overtime, while the Rockets (12 - 7) were able to pull away with the combination of Harden and Trevor Ariza at the free throw line. Harden went on to finish with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists on 8 - of - 23 shooting, including 11 - of - 14 from the charity stripe. Ryan Anderson matched Harden in scoring with 29 points, while Eric Gordon pitched in another 20 - plus point bench performance on his way to 23 points in total. Golden State utilized every player on their bench, which ran eight players deep. Only Iguodala finished in double figures with 10 points, to go along with four rebounds and five assists which also included stellar defensive play.
