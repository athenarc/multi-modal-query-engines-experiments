The Washington Wizards (17 - 6) defeated the Utah Jazz (6 - 18) 93 - 84 on Sunday. Washington has taken advantage of a relatively easy part of their schedule to win four straight and eight of their last nine. Bradley Beal has started to break through his early - season rust and scored the game - high in points for the second straight game, finishing with 22 points Sunday. The Wizards help the Jazz to 39 percent shooting while converting 49 percent of their own shots from the field to secure the win. Utah has lost 11 of their last 12 games. They were without Derrick Favors (ankle) on Sunday, but Favors is travelling with the team on their six - game road trip, indicating that he could return sooner than later. Sophomore center Rudy Gobert earned the first start of his career in Favors' absence. Gobert put up seven points, nine rebounds and three blocks in 31 minutes. At 7 - 1, he has the tools to be one of the best shot blockers in the league if given the minutes. The Jazz continue their road trip in New Orleans on Tuesday against the Pelicans.
