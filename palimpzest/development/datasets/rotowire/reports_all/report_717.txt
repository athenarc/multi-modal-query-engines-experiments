The Indiana Pacers (11 - 20) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (13 - 16) 110 - 85 on Saturday. Indiana has won three of their last four games, and the return of George Hill to the active roster three games ago has given them reason to be optimistic. The Pacers brought Hill off the bench for his first two games but moved him into the starting lineup at point guard Saturday. He finished with 12 points, six rebounds and five assists in 23 minutes. Seven players scored in double figures for Indiana, with Rodney Stuckey scoring a team - high 20 points. The Pacers will try to keep the good times rolling when they host the Chicago Bulls on Monday. Brooklyn had their three - game win streak come to an end with the loss. Jarrett Jack started a second straight game with Deron Williams coming off the bench, and Brook Lopez came off the bench for a third straight game behind Mason Plumlee as coach Lionel Hollins continues to play the guys he thinks are getting the job done instead of just lining up his five most expensive contracts against other teams. The Nets shot 36 percent from the field and gave away 19 easy points on 15 turnovers, digging holes they could n't climb out of. Brooklyn will host the Sacramento Kings on Monday.
