Westbrook has been making triple - doubles look easy all season and he did that yet again in this win. He finished this game with 29 points, 17 rebounds and 11 assists en route to his 15th triple - double of the season. Many of the statistics were lopsided for the Thunder, as they dominated from start to finish. Rebounding was very decisive, as Oklahoma City won that battle, 46 - 32. Fastbreak points and points in the paint were huge as well, with the Thunder outscoring the Heat, 58 - 32 in the paint and 16 - 4 in fastbreak points. Steven Adams was the only other Thunder starter in double figures, as he totaled 15 points and eight rebounds on 7 - of - 10 shooting. Enes Kanter came off the bench to provide 19 points and eight rebounds of his own. Josh Richardson was the lone bright spot for Miami, as he led the team with 22 points, five rebounds and three assists.
