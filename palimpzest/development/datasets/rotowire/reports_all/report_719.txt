The Miami Heat defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 125 - 102, at American Airlines Arena on Saturday. The Heat (21 - 30) was red - hot coming in to Saturday's contest and seemed primed to continue their streak, considering they were facing a Sixers team that had dropped four of their last five games and would be without their most potent offensive weapon in Joel Embiid (knee). Miami made good on that prognosis, ambushing their vistors by a 32 - 17 margin in the first quarter and never really letting up. Hassan Whiteside led the way with a monstrous 30 - point, 20 - rebound double - double that also included a trio of blocks, and the Miami bench totaled 50 points overall. They also posted outstanding 59 and 55 percent success rates from the field and three - point range, respectively, allowing them to overcome the 20 turnovers they were guilty of. The Sixers (18 - 32) were led by Ersan Ilyasova, who posted 21 points, five rebounds and two assists. Gerald Henderson was next with 12 points, two assists and two steals. Richaun Holmes followed with a near double - double with 12 points, nine rebounds, two assists and one steal. T.J. McConnell generated 11 points, four assists and two rebounds. Sean Rodriguez contributed 10 points, one rebound and one assist as a reserve as well. Dion Waiters followed Whiteside with 21 points, seven assists, one rebound, two steals and one block. Goran Dragic was next with 16 points, eight assists and four rebounds. Tyler Johnson led the bench with 16 points, six rebounds, six assists, one block and one steal. Wayne Ellington and James Johnson were productive as reserves as well, with the former tallying 11 points, two rebounds and one steal and the latter offering 10 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals. The Sixers head to Detroit to take on the Pistons on Monday night, while the Heat head to Minnesota to take on the Timberwolves on Monday evening as well.
