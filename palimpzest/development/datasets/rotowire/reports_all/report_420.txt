The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 110 - 106, at Quicken Loans Arena on Tuesday. The reigning NBA champs came into Tuesday as the league's last undefeated team, with four of their victories having come at home. However, Atlanta (5 - 2) came into the game sporting one of the NBA's stingiest defenses, having allowed the sixth - least points per game. Something was likely to give, and surprisingly, it was Cleveland's (6 - 1) unblemished mark. The Hawks got standout efforts from Dennis Schroder, Kent Bazemore and Paul Millsap, while Dwight Howard also hauled in 17 rebounds. Bazemore drilled a key jumper with 7 seconds remaining to help seal the win and cap off a stellar 51 percent shooting night for Atlanta. Schroder's season - high 28 points led the Hawks, which he complemented with six assists and two rebounds. Bazemore totaled 25 points, six rebounds and three assists, and drained four of his six three - point attempts. Millsap pitched in 21 points, five boards and an assist, while Howard added seven points, two assists and three blocks. Mike Muscala paced the bench with 10 points, three rebounds, two assists and a block. The Cavs were led by Kyrie Irving's game - high 29 points, which he needed a whopping 27 shot attempts to get to. He also posted four assists, a rebound, a steal and a block. Kevin Love continued his stretch of excellent early - season play, supplying 24 points, 12 rebounds, three assists and two steals. LeBron James registered a typically full stat line of 23 points, nine rebounds, five assists and three steals. Channing Frye led the reserves with 13 points, seven rebounds and an assist. The Hawks head back home to take on the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night, while the Cavaliers travel to Washington to take on the Wizards on Friday evening.
