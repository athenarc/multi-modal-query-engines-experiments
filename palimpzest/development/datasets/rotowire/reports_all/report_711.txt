The Phoenix Suns (13 - 14) got the job done on the road against the Charlotte Hornets (6 - 19) 111 - 106 on Wednesday. Phoenix came into this one looking to grab a much - needed win, and they did just that. It was n't easy, but thanks to some solid guard play, they left Charlotte with a win. Goran Dragic (back) returned from a two - game absence, leading the way with 20 points (8 - 17 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), eight assists, three rebounds and one steal in 37 minutes. Isaiah Thomas once again excelled in his role off the bench, scoring 23 points (7 - 13 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt, 6 - 10 FT) to go with three assists and three rebounds. In total, the Suns had six players score in double figures, with Gerald Green posting 16 off the bench, and Eric Bledsoe scoring 15 points in 39 minutes. The Suns outscored the Hornets 28 - 19 in the fourth quarter, which ended up being the difference. The Hornets are searching for answers right now, and with trade rumors flying about Lance Stephenson, he put up another mediocre game. Stephenson scored just seven points (3 - 8 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) to go with four rebounds and two assists in only 25 minutes. It was the combo of Al Jefferson (28 points and 10 rebounds) and Kemba Walker (27 points and seven assists) that led the way, but they still fell short. Cody Zeller was playing through a broken nose, and earns the all - effort award for playing 24 minutes, scoring seven points and bringing in nine rebounds while fighting through the discomfort.
