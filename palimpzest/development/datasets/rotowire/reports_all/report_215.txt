Monday night's affair was all about the point guards, with the Thunder's Russell Westbrook and the Hawks' Dennis Schroeder performing at their best. While Schroder got the win, Westbrook edged him out in the box score, posting 46 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists to Schroder's 31 points, eight assists and five rebounds. For Westbrook, it was his fourth game this season with at least 40 points but his first without a triple - double to go along with it. Combined with Saturday's monster performance, Westbrook has now posted 72 points, 29 assists and 22 rebonds over his last two games. For Schroder, it was just his second performance this season with at least 30 points, but after shooting 63 percent from the field Monday, the point guard has now shot over 50 percent in seven of his nine games in December after shooting a poor 42 percent from the field throughout November.
