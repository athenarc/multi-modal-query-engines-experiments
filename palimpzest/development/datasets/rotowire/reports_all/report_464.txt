Lou Williams led all scorers with 38 points in 34 minutes off the bench, but it was not enough to secure a victory, as the Utah Jazz went on to claim the road win at Staples Center. Utah capitalized off sharing the ball, noted by their 26 assists as a unit, and that all five starters finished in double figures scoring. Rudy Gobert's efforts on both end of the floor continue to drive the Jazz, and he went on to finish with 14 points, 17 rebounds and five blocks in 39 minutes. Gordon Hayward once again led the Jazz in scoring, although the volume of shots was not perfectly in sync with the output, Hayward managed 23 points, six rebounds, five assists and two steals on 7 - of - 16 shooting, including three shots buried from behind the arc.
