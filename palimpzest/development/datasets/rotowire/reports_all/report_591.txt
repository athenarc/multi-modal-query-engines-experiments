The Milwaukee Bucks (39 - 40) defeated the New York Knicks (15 - 64) 99 - 91 on Friday in New York. It was rough for the Bucks in the first half, as they found themselves down by as much as six to the NBA's worst team. But they were able to kick it up a notch in the third quarter and outscore the Knicks by 13 in the period, and they were able to take care of business from there. Giannis Antetokounmpo was thrust back into the starting lineup after a DNP (coach's decision) in Milwaukee's last game, and he played very well, scoring 23 points (7 - 14 FG, 9 - 11 FT) and grabbing nine rebounds in 31 minutes. Khris Middleton was not far behind, posting 22 points (9 - 16 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt), seven rebounds and he was very active defensively with six steals in 35 minutes. Michael Carter-Williams also continued his strong play as of late, scoring 19 points (8 - 13 FG), seven assists and four steals in 31 minutes. In his last two games, Carter-Williams has now combined for 49 points and 15 assists. As a team, the Bucks recorded an astounding 17 steals, and the victory keeps them in sixth place in the Eastern Conference. For now, they sit there comfortably with a two - game lead for that position with just three games remaining in the regular season. The dreadful season for the Knicks continues, as this loss is their 11th in their last 12 games. Langston Galloway was once again solid in the losing effort, scoring 20 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting in 35 minutes. Four other New York players scored in double figures, with Lance Thomas (16), Shane Larkin (14), Jason Smith (11) and Lou Amundson (10) rounding out the five total. Andrea Bargnani sat out this game with an illness. The Knicks recorded a dreadful 24 turnovers to just 22 assists, and they continue to boast the worst record in the NBA this season. Up next, the Bucks will head home Sunday to take on the Nets, while the Knicks will travel to Orlando Saturday to play the Magic.
