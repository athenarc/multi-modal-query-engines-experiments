The Los Angeles Clippers (34 - 17) defeated the Miami Heat (29 - 23) 100 - 93 on Sunday. In a game full of All-Stars, all the studs shot poorly. All three players who were voted into this year's All-Star game took at least 17 shots and all three shot 35 percent or below from the field. That killed Miami all - around as well, with the team combining to shoot below 40 percent in the defeat. The turnovers were huge, with the Clippers forcing 13 turnovers, while committing just seven of their own. The Clippers continue to play good ball, as they won this game as a road underdog. Chris Paul was the star for Los Angeles, as he scored 22 points and dished out seven assists in the win, despite shooting 8 - for - 23 from the field. Jamal Crawford scored 20 points once again, which marked his fourth - straight time doing that off the bench. The Clippers have a short turnaround, as they play the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday in their next game. Miami simply couldn’t buy a shot and it was amazing they hung around as long as they did. Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh scored 17 points each, but combined to shoot 12 - for - 37 from the field and 7 - for - 12 from the free - throw line. Goran Dragic played well though, as he amassed 17 points of his own, while also handing out five assists and grabbing five boards. It doesn’t get much easier in the Heat's next game, as they host the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday.
