The San Antonio Spurs (4 - 2) blew out the Charlotte Hornets (2 - 4) 114 - 94 on Saturday night. The Spurs were simply fantastic offensively in this matchup, as they shot over 50 percent from the field and accumulated 35 assists as a team. The third quarter was when the tide turned for both teams, as the Spurs scored 42 points in the quarter, which included an 180 run. This was an utter domination in nearly every statistic, as the Spurs had more rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and less turnovers than the Hornets in the win. Point guard Kemba Walker might have had his best game of the season on Saturday for Charlotte and it was all for nothing. He tallied 27 points, four assists and two steals on 11 - of - 15 shooting in under 30 minutes of action. The problem for the Hornets was that the only player who scored more than 13 points was Walker and that simply wo n't get it done against a team like the Spurs. They also shot below 65 percent from the free - throw line and all that makes for a recipe of disaster. Charlotte has a few days off until they play the Minnesota Timberwolves in a very winable game on Tuesday. The Spurs were at top form on Saturday, as they outscored the Hornets by 16 points in the second half. They played some typical Spurs basketball, as they dished out 35 team assists, while shooting 56 percent from the field. San Antonio was led by Kawhi Leonard who scored a team - high 23 points in the victory. The bench was spectacular as well, as they got 15 points from Patty Mills, 13 points from Manu Ginobili and a near triple - double from David West. The Spurs will look to carry this sparkling form into Monday's matchup against a struggling Sacramento Kings team.
