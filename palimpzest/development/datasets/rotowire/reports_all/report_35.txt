The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Dallas Mavericks 94 - 97 Wednesday at American Airlines Center. The Spurs (14 - 4) were playing their second leg of a back - to - back, but we able to bounce back nicely against Dallas (3 - 13) after dropping Tuesday's matchup against the Magic. San Antonio rested Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Pau Gasol on the second leg, but still managed to put together a solid offensive performance, shooting 47 percent from the field and an astounding 58 percent from behind the arc. It was backup point guard Patty Mills who shined off the bench Wednesday, as he shot 9 - of - 12 shooting from the field overall and 5 - of - 6 from behind the arc en route to a team - high 23 points. And it was a necessary effort, as the team's stars in Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge struggled mightily. Leonard managed 21 points, but shot just 5 - of - 16 from the field, while Aldridge could not get anything going, scoring just five points on 2 - of - 9 shooting. Danny Green was the only other Spur to score in double figures, notching 11 points. For the Mavericks, they continue to slide, with Wednesday's loss being their ninth in their last 10 games. It was yet another offensive struggle for Dallas too, with Wednesday's 87 points being the seventh time this season where they failed to score 90 points. Wesley Mathews led the way, scoring a game - high 26 points in 37 minutes. Harrison Barnes was the only other starter to reach double figures with 17 points, while Seth Curry and Dwight Powell scoring double figures off the bench, scoring 14 and 10 points respectively. As a team, the Mavericks shot a lowly 43 percent from the field. Up next, the Spurs will head home Friday to take on the Wizards, while the Mavericks will look to turn their season around in Charlotte on Thursday against the Hornets.
