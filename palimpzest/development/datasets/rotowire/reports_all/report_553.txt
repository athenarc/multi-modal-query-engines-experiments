The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Boston Celtics, 102 - 101, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference first - round playoffs on Saturday at Philips Arena. This wasn’t the prettiest game by any means, but the Hawks held off a feisty Celtics bunch for a crucial Game 1 win. Boston shot just 23 percent in a 34 - point first half and that ultimately built too deep of a hole to climb out of. The defense was key for Atlanta, as they held Boston to 36 percent shooting from the field and stifled for the majority of the game. Boston did outscore Atlanta 67 to 51 in the second half, but it simply wasn’t enough. The Hawks also took 35 free - throws compared to the Celtics 19, as Boston simply couldn’t stop fouling. Boston played great in the second half, but a terrible first half held them back in this loss. Isaiah Thomas led the team with 27 points and also dished out eight assists in the loss. Avery Bradley had 18 points through three quarters, but had to leave early with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. Jae Crowder recorded a double - double in a 14 - point, 10 - rebound outing. Atlanta didn’t play their best game, but they escaped with a narrow win. Al Horford led the team with 24 points, while also snatching down 12 rebounds. Jeff Teague was fantastic as well, accumulating 23 points, 12 assists and four rebounds in the win. Kent Bazemore had one of his best games of the season, scoring 23 points and grabbing eight rebounds. Game 2 will be on Tuesday in Atlanta with the Hawks being a projected five - point favorite.
