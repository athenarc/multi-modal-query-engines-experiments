Serge Ibaka was the story coming into Sunday's matchup and he did n't disappoint. Not only did he score a career - high 31 points, he hit a game - winning jumper with just 0 seconds left. He was n't the only one in a revenge game though, as Victor Oladipo scored 12 points against his former team. Russell Westbrook added to his absurd averages, as he tallied 41 points, 12 rebounds and 16 assists in the defeat. This game was full of swings, as the Magic led by 21 in the first half, before the Thunder went on a 17 - 2 run in the third quarter to take a brief lead. While Oklahoma City did shoot over 50 percent from the field, they really struggled with threes and free - throws. In fact, they shot just 28 percent from three - point range and 61 percent from the free - throw line. There were 116 combined points in the paint, as defense became an optional facet of this game.
