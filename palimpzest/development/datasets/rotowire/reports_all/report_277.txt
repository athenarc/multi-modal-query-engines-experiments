The Memphis Grizzlies (16 - 4) defeated the Miami Heat (9 - 11) 103 - 87 on Sunday at Fed Ex Forum Arena in Memphis. Despite only leading 82 - 75 going into the fourth quarter, the Grizzlies were able to out - score the Heat 21 - 12 in the final quarter to give themselves a comfortable 16 - point victory at home. Memphis was able to shoot extremely well in this one, as they went 59 percent from the field and a ridiculous 62 percent from the three - point line. Miami on the other hand finished at only 49 percent from the floor and 31 percent from beyond the arc. In a surprise performance off the bench, Jon Leuer was a big contributor to the Grizzlies superior shooting percentages. He went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 20 points in 23 minutes. He also had a season - high of 10 rebounds, giving him his first double - double of the year. He's averaging just over 14 minutes per game on the season, so he was able to cash in on the extra playing time he received. Mike Conley also had one of his better games of the season. He went a perfect 8 - for - 8 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from beyond the arc to score 18 points in only 27 minutes. He had 23 points against the Spurs on Friday and 15 against a tough Rockets team Wednesday, so he's had a nice stretch of games during the last week. Courtney Lee (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 3 3Pt) and Zach Randolph (8 - 15 FG, 1 - 1 FT) also reached double figures in points with 17 apiece. Marc Gasol was one of the lone players to struggle offensively, as he had only two points in 27 minutes, but he still had six rebounds and seven assists, so it was n't all bad for Gasol. Dwyane Wade had a strong game for the Heat. He went 11 - for - 20 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the free throw line to score 25 points, while also adding six assists. He's caught fire in the last three games, scoring 28, 28 and now 25 over that stretch. Wade is now averaging 22 points and 6 assists on the season. Chris Bosh did n't have as big of a game as he's come accustomed to. He scored 12 points (6 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 0 - 2 FT) and recorded only two rebounds in 35 minutes. It was his first time in nine games not reaching at least 15 points, and only the second time all season grabbing less than five rebounds, so do n't expect him to have this sort of game again any time soon. Mario Chalmers had 12 out of the 19 points from the Heat's bench, while also notching his second game in row with at least four steals. The rest of the bench really struggled, which may have been the deciding factor in this one. The Grizzlies' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, while the Heat will travel to Phoenix to play the Suns on Tuesday.
