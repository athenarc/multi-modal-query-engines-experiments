The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons, 104 - 81, at Quicken Loans Arena on Friday. After resting LeBron James and J.R. Smith in their last contest, the Cavs (10 - 2) came in to Friday's matchup with their starting five fully intact. While the Big Three of James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving turned in their typically solid offensive performances, it was a suffocating defense that keyed the comfortable victory. Cleveland held the Pistons (6 - 7) to a 31 percent success rate from the field and only one Detroit player, Jon Leuer, was able to post double - digit scoring. The Cavaliers jumped out to a 30 - 19 lead in the first quarter, an advantage they would never relinquish. The Pistons' top scorers were Tobias Harris and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who each tallied a pair of nine - point efforts. Andre Drummond supplied a modest eight points, but he was able to haul in 10 rebounds and also dished out two assists and recorded a steal and a block. Marcus Morris continued his offensive slump with a seven - point output on 3 - of - 11 shooting, making it his third straight game with single - digit scoring. Leuer added seven rebounds to his team - high scoring effort. Irving paced Cleveland with 25 points, 11 assists, two rebounds and a steal. James posted 21 points, three rebounds, three assists and a block. Love put together a 12 - point, 13 - rebound double - double that also included an assist. Tristan Thompson registered eight points but also brought in 14 boards, dished out two assists and recorded four blocks. Iman Shumpert led the reserves with nine points. The Pistons head back home to await the Boston Celtics for a Saturday night showdown, while the Cavaliers will have four days off before taking on the visiting Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.
