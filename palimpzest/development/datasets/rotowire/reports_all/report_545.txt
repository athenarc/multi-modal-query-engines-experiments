The visiting Utah Jazz destroyed the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, 127 - 94. Utah (34 - 19) earned its fourth straight victory in style on Wednesday, eviscerating the Pelicans in one of their most convincing wins of the season. The Jazz outscored the Pels in every quarter and seemingly could do no wrong all night. They finished shooting over 54 percent with 14 three - pointers, 25 assists, and a 48 - 37 advantage in rebounding. One key difference - maker was the strength of Utah's bench. Veteran Joe Johnson led the team in scoring with 27 points off the bench, while two other members of the second unit scored in double figures. It was a strong night for Utah's starters as well, including center Rudy Gobert. Gobert played stellar defense on New Orleans superstar Anthony Davis, and also pulled down a team - high 16 rebounds. New Orleans (20 - 33), meanwhile, has now lost five of its last six games. Despite a strong defensive night in which he blocked six shots, star big man Anthony Davis had a lackluster performance on the offensive end, shooting just 4 - of - 12 for only 12 points. One of the main struggles for New Orleans was hitting shots from long - range, as the team shot only 5 - of - 20 from beyond the arc. Ball movement was also an issue, as the team posted only 17 assists on the night. The Jazz will visit Dallas to play the Mavericks on Thursday, while New Orleans will travel to Minnesota to battle the Timberwolves on Friday.
