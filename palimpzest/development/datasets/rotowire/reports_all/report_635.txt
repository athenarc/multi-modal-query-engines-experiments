The Toronto Raptors (37 - 18) were unable to sustain the momentum from Friday's win over the Hawks as they were soundly defeated by the Houston Rockets (37 - 18) Saturday by a final score of 98 - 76. It was a surprisingly low scoring contest for two of the top scoring teams in the league through three quarters as the Rockets led the Raptors 68 - 53 heading into the fourth. Houston held Toronto to a paltry 33 percent shooting percentage from the field as it cruised to an easy victory. Toronto came into Saturday's contest on the heels of a 105 - 80 thrashing of the Hawks in Atlanta on Friday, but came out flat. The Raptors were missing Lou Williams for this game as he was sidelined with a sprained left ankle. Toronto now holds a 3 game lead over Chicago for the second seed in the East. The Raptors will return to the floor Monday to take on the Pelicans. Houston shook off a 111 - 100 loss to Dallas on Friday to notch its 37th win of the season thanks in part to a big game from Corey Brewer. On a night where just two Rockets starters scored in double - figures, Brewer poured in a team - high 26 points in 35 minutes off the bench. Recently acquired K.J McDaniels and Pablo Prigioni made their Rockets debuts in this game, each going scoreless in four minutes of playing time. The Rockets are idle Sunday before hosting the Timberwolves on Monday.
