The Charlotte Hornets (21 - 27) defeated the Washington Wizards (31 - 18) 92 - 88 on Monday at the Verizon Center in Washington. This ended up being a very evenly played game between the two Eastern Conference teams. The Hornets were the superior shooters in this game though, going 47 percent from the field, while the Wizards shot just 41 percent from the floor. The Wizards did take the advantage from the free throw line though, making 16 - of - 19 attempts, while the Hornets converted on 14 - of - 19. The Hornets were led by Al Jefferson in this game, who went 9 - for - 19 from the floor to score 18 points, while also recording 12 rebounds and two steals. It was the second time in the last three games he's posted a double - double, while the two steals matched a season - high for the center. Continuing to replace Kemba Walker in the starting lineup, Brian Roberts had a solid showing, contributing 18 points (6 - 10 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and three assists in 34 minutes. After going scoreless in Saturday's game against the Denver Nuggets, it was a nice bounce back game for him. Gerald Henderson had a nice showing from the floor, finishing with 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and five assists. In his last three games he's now averaged 14 points. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist added a double - double with 13 points (4 - 6 FG, 5 - 10 FT) and 13 rebounds as well. As expected, the Wizards got most of their production from their backcourt duo of Bradley Beal and John Wall. Each recorded a double - double, as Beal had 18 points (7 - 16 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and 11 rebounds, while Wall posted 16 points (4 - 14 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 7 - 7 FT) and 10 assists. Beal has turned it on over his last two games, combining for 44 points and 14 rebounds. He's now averaging 15 points and 4 rebounds on the season. This double - double marked the second in a row for Wall, who's combined for 44 points and 22 asssists over his last two games. While both the guards had solid showings, they did n't get enough help from their supporting cast. Coming off the bench, Kris Humphries was the only bench player to reach double figures, finishing with 13 points (4 - 8 FG, 5 - 6 FT) and five rebounds in 25 minutes. The Hornets' next game will be at home against the Washington Wizards again on Thursday, while the Wizards will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Wednesday, before heading to Charlotte to play the Hornets again on Thursday.
