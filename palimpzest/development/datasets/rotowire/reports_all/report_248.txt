The Indiana Pacers (16 - 9) dealt the Brooklyn Nets (7 - 19) their fourth straight loss on Friday, winning 104 - 97. Despite struggles from some of their starters, including star Paul George (seven turnovers) and guard Monta Ellis (1 - for - 8 shooting, two points), the Pacers were able to comfortably defeat Brooklyn for their fourth win in five games. Indiana's strong showing can be attributed largely to their bench, as sixth man Rodney Stuckey racked up 15 points, while backup big man Jordan Hill recorded a 14 - point, 11 - rebound double - double. The win puts Indiana just one game behind the Cavaliers for the first seed in the Eastern Conference. While Brooklyn got off to a hot start in the month of December, they now face a four - game losing streak and remain the second - worst team in the Eastern Conference. Even in the face of the loss, Thaddeus Young's surprising rebounding renaissance continued, with the power forward pulling down 14 boards, including six offensive. Young is averaging nine rebounds per game on the season, almost four more than his career average. Point guard Jarrett Jack also impressed, tallying 26 points to go with nine rebounds and six assists. The dominance of Indiana and comeback star Paul George has been one of the biggest surprises of the 2015 - 16 season. With the Pacers on a tear lately, they will carry strong momentum into their matchup in Memphis on Saturday. The Nets, meanwhile, continue to struggle. They will hope to capitalize on a manageable matchup against the aching Timberwolves on Sunday.
