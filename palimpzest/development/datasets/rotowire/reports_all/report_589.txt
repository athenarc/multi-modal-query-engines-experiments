The San Antonio Spurs (27 - 16) defeated the Denver Nuggets (18 - 24) 109 - 99 on Tuesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver. Coming out of the third quarter up just 80 - 76, the Spurs had a fantastic fourth quarter both offensively and defensively, out - scoring the Nuggets 29 - 23 to secure the 10 - point victory on the road. The Spurs were able to shoot 11 - for - 27 from the three - point line, while the Nuggets shot just 5 - of - 14, which may have been the difference in this one. After playing in only 23 minutes during Sunday's game against the Utah Jazz, Tony Parker returned to playing a full minutes load, finishing with a team - high of 18 points (8 - 16 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), while also adding seven assists in 32 minutes. It did n't look as if he suffered any setbacks in the win, so hopefully he can continue to play without a minutes restriction moving forward. Kawhi Leonard had a very good showing. He went 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while recording 15 rebounds. The double - double marked his seventh of the season. Tim Duncan reached double figures as well with 16 points (6 - 10 FG, 4 - 4 FT). He had a season - low of five rebounds, but the Spurs were still able to secure the win. Coming off the bench, Aron Baynes had his second successful night in a row. He went a perfect 3 - for - 3 from the field and 9 - for - 9 from the free throw line to score 15 points in only 15 minutes. In Sunday's game he had 12 points and 11 rebounds, so he was able to stay hot in the victory. For the Nuggets, Kenneth Faried and Arron Afflalo did most of the damage against the Spurs. Faried finished with 26 points (9 - 17 FG, 8 - 12 FT) and 14 rebounds, marking his first double - double in the last four games. He only scored a combined 13 points over his last two outings, so it was a huge bounce back game for him. Afflalo on the other hand shot 6 - for - 11 from the field and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 21 points, while adding three steals. He had only two points in Monday's loss to the Warriors, so like Faried, it was good to see him turn things around. Rookie center Jusuf Nurkic nearly had a double - double of his own, finishing with 10 points and nine rebounds. He's now averaging 7 points and 6 rebounds so far this season. The only other Nugget to reach double figures in points was Wilson Chandler who had 11 points (5 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 3 FT) in 37 minutes. The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday, while the Nuggets will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Friday.
