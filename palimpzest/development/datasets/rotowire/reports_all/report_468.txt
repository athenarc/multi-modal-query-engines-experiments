After allowing a massive 38 points in the first quarter, the New Orleans Pelicans (14 - 27) secured their third victory in four games with a 114 - 99 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves (13 - 30). Superstar Anthony Davis dropped in a game - high 35 points, helping propel the Pelicans to victory. Davis has flown under the radar in the Pelicans' disappointing season, despite his impressive averages of 23 points, 11 rebounds, and 3 blocks per game. "The Brow" currently sits at fourth in the league in double - doubles this season, and has been a major part of New Orlean's increasing success as of late. Point guard Jrue Holiday also exploded off the bench in the win over Minnesota, delivering 19 points and nine assists in 27 minutes of action. The former All-Star has averaged 18 points and 10 assists over his last three games while turning the ball over just four times in total. Minnesota's season has deteriorated rapidly, as the team has now lost seven straight on the road. Rookie sensation Karl-Anthony Towns continues to be a bright spot in the Timberwolves' unpleasant season. Towns has posted rookie - best averages of 16 points and 10 rebounds per game, numbers which he added to in New Orleans. The rookie center tallied 20 points, 13 rebounds, a block and a steal in the loss to the Pelicans. Reigning Rookie of the Year Andrew Wiggins, meanwhile, led the team with 21 points and also grabbed three steals. The Timberwolves' next matchup takes the team to Dallas, where they will face the Mavericks to round out a double - header on Monday. The Pelicans may see their luck tested, meanwhile, as they see the Pistons on Tuesday. Detroit is fresh off a blowout of the league - best Golden State Warriors.
