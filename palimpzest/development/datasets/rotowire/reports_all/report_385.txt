The host Utah Jazz beat the visiting Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, 96 - 89. It was the season debut for banged - up Jazz star Derrick Favors. Favors missed the majority of the preseason and the team's season opener with a bruised knee, but was able to transition back into a limited role for Friday's contest. The forward came off the bench for an impressive 15 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes, but showed some signs of rust, turning the ball over five times. His typical frontcourt partner, French seven - footer Rudy Gobert, made a major impact on the defensive end with four blocks. Gobert's six offensive rebounds also helped the Jazz overcome a poor perimeter shooting night, offering Utah a number of second - chance attempts. The Lakers, meanwhile, received troubling news, as rookie Brandon Ingram was forced to leave the game with a knee injury after just four minutes of play. Though not appearing to be serious, the second overall pick will likely be monitored closely going forward. It was a tough night for young Lakers in general, as guard D'Angelo Russell went just 3 - for - 14 from the field, while forward Julius Randle scored just seven points and recorded only four rebounds. The Lakers did manage to find a scoring boost off the bench, as sixth man Lou Williams led the team with 17. Both teams will travel on Sunday, with the Jazz visiting the Los Angeles Clippers and the Lakers taking on the Thunder in Oklahoma City.
