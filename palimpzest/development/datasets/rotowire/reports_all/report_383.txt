The Memphis Grizzlies (50 - 21) defeated the New York Knicks (14 - 57) 103 - 82 on Monday at Madison Square Garden in New York. While the Knicks have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Grizzlies continue to sit comfortable in the top half of the Western Conference standings. They currently remain two and a half games above the Houston Rockets for the second seed in the West, but also trail the Golden State Warriors by seven games for the top overall seed. The Grizzlies were the much better shooting team in this game, going 52 percent from the field and an impressive 58 percent from the three - point line, while the Knicks ended at just 42 percent from the floor and a meager 22 percent from deep. The Grizzlies' starting frontcourt came up big again Monday, as they combined to score 56 of the 103 total points.

Marc Gasol also had a strong showing, posting 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and eight rebounds over 32 minutes. Gasol shot just 27 percent (4 - 15 FG) from the field during Saturday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers, so it was good to see him have a lot more success on Monday. Jeff Green chipped in with 12 points (4 - 9 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds as well. It was Vince Carter and Kosta Koufos who provided a nice push off the bench. Carter finished with 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) in 21 minutes, while Koufos recorded 10 points (5 - 7 FG) and five rebounds in 16 minutes. Langston Galloway did his best to keep the Knicks in this game, going 7 - for - 16 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 19 points, while also adding seven rebounds and five assists. He had combined to go 5 - for - 22 from the floor and just 1 - for - 7 from deep over his last two games, so it was a breath of fresh air for Knicks' fans seeing Galloway shoot a little better Monday. Andrea Bargnani did his part as well, posting 18 points (8 - 18 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and two blocked shots in 31 minutes. He's been one of the more consistent players for this team, averaging 17 points, 4 rebounds and one blocked shot during his last 10 games. With Alexey Shved sidelined with a rib injury, Shane Larkin moved into the starting lineup, but he contributed just four points (2 - 7 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt) and seven assists in 43 minutes. Lance Thomas chipped in with 15 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and two steals, while Jason Smith came off the bench for 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and four rebounds.
