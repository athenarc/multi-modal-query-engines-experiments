The New York Knicks (18 - 19) took down the Miami Heat (21 - 14) on Wednesday, 98 - 90, in a battle of two of the Eastern Conference's most improved teams. The Knicks became the first team in the league to match their win total from 2014 - 15 on Tuesday, as defeated the Hawks for their 17th win of the season. New York has now won three in a row, and sits just one game shy of .500. The Knicks' efforts were bolstered, as always, by the play of superstar Carmelo Anthony. After posting a big double - double in Atlanta, Melo continued to shine as he dropped in 25 points to go with five rebounds and four assists. Offseason acquisition Robin Lopez also posted an impressive 19 points on 9 - for - 12 shooting. Highly-publicized rookie Kristaps Porzingis, however, had an underwhelming night, posting just 10 points and four rebounds on 3 - of - 10 shooting. The rookie got off to a ridiculously hot start to the season, but slowed down a bit starting in early December. The Heat had been carrying a three game win - streak headed into their matchup against New York. Miami, who missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years last season, now sits well above .500 and leads the Southeast Division. Perennial All-Star Chris Bosh lit it up for Miami against New York, knocking down 12 shots for 28 points. Ultimately, Bosh's efforts were n't enough for the Heat to get past Melo and the Knicks, however. Miami will look to turn things around on Friday as they travel to Phoenix to take on the struggling Suns. For the Knicks, on the other hand, maintaining the win streak will be difficult, as they travel to San Antonio on Friday to face off against the Spurs. San Antonio remains a perfect 200 at home.
