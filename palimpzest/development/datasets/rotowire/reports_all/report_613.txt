With President Barack Obama in town Tuesday to check in on his hometown team, the Bulls were able to come away with a victory on their home court, defeating the Cavaliers by a 97 - 95 count. The Cavaliers remained competitive through the fourth quarter thanks largely to the efforts of LeBron James, who poured in 25 points, 10 rebounds, five steals over 36 minutes. The same couldn’t be said of James’ co - star, Kevin Love, who was playing in his first meaningful game since dislocating his elbow in the first round of last season’s playoffs. Love would end up with 18 points thanks to a hot fourth quarter, but shot a woeful 6 - for - 17 from the field. Even with Love back in the fold, the Cavaliers were still playing at less than full strength with backcourt starters Kyrie Irving (knee) and Iman Shumpert (wrist) out for extended action. While their replacements in the lineup, Mo Williams (19 points, seven assists) and J.R. Smith (eight points, five boards, three assists) had their moments, they couldn’t keep up with an effective Bulls attack. Despite entering the game with some uncertainty regarding how much playing time he’d receive while he continued to experience blurred vision, Derrick Rose turned in a strong outing for the Bulls, contributing 18 points and five assists in 32 minutes. Along with Rose, second - year man Nikola Mirotic drove the Chicago attack, piling up 19 points and nine rebounds. Meanwhile, the man Mirotic replaced in the starting lineup, Joakim Noah, failed to record any points in 17 minutes, before limping off the court in the second half after taking a hard hit to the ankle. The Bulls didn’t provide an update on his condition before the game ended. After holding off the Cavs, the Bulls will look to push their record to 20 when they head to Brooklyn for a game Wednesday. Cleveland will also finish off a back - to - back set Wednesday with a date in Memphis.
