The Denver Nuggets (19 - 27) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (24 - 22) 93 - 85 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. The Nuggets shot much better than the Pelicans in this game, going 46 percent from the field and an impressive 59 percent from the three - point line, while the Pelicans shot 39 percent from the floor and just 20 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans out - rebounded the Nuggets 48 - 39, but it was n't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance, as they dropped a tough loss at home. Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 20 points. It was his second solid game in a row, combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span. Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double - double, finishing with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He has n't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 7 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate. Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11 - 22 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25 - point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds. The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday, while the Pelicans will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday.
