The Detroit Pistons (3 - 6) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (3 - 7) 96 - 89 in overtime on Friday. Brandon Jennings paced the Pistons, scoring a team - high 29 points in 36 minutes. They had dropped three straight games before pulling out the win over the injury - depleted Thunder. Since being challenged by coach Stan Van Gundy to start being more aggressive on offense, Jennings has responded by looking for his shot earlier in games. The Pistons finish their four - game road trip in Memphis on Saturday against the Grizzlies. Despite playing without their two MVP-level players in Russell Westbrook (hand) and Kevin Durant (foot), the Thunder have competed realitively well. They're 2 - 2 in their last four games, and Reggie Jackson continues to put up All-Star numbers to try and show that he is indeed an All-Star caliber player when given the minutes and possessions to prove it. Jeremy Lamb bounced back from two poor games to score a team - high 24 points. The Thunder have a day off before hosting the Houston Rockets on Sunday.
