The Orlando Magic defeated the host Miami Heat, 136 - 130, in double - overtime at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday. These are two teams that have struggled offensively all season, so a numbers boosting double - overtime game may be what they need to find some momentum. Orlando were the ones who escaped with the win, as they won the second overtime, 18 - 12. Shooting was key for the Magic, as they shot 50 percent from the field and from three - point range. Both teams struggled at the free - throw line, as they each failed to crack 70 percent shooting. There were 10 ties and 27 lead changes in total, with neither team leading by more than 12 points. Orlando (13 - 17) have n't had much to get excited about this season, but a double - overtime road win may be just what they need to get going.

Evan Fournier matched his 26 points and added five rebounds and four assists to his tally in the victory. Serge Ibaka accumulated 20 points, nine rebounds and two assists. Elfrid Payton came off the bench to collect 22 points, two rebounds and six assists. Orlando will return to action on Thursday in a road matchup with the New York Knicks. Miami (9 - 20) continue to play well, but they simply ca n't win games. Hassan Whiteside did all he could though, as he had game - highs with 32 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks in the defeat. Tyler Johnson was fantastic off the bench, accruing a career - high 32 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals before fouling out in overtime. Goran Dragic went just 6 - of - 17 from the field, but tallied 19 points, four rebounds and five assists before fouling out himself.
