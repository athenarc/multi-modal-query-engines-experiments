The league's top two scorers had the chance to square off on Sunday, and they did not leave fans disappointed. For the Thunder, All-Star guard Russell Westbrook posted a line of 28 points, 17 rebounds, and 12 assists for his fifth consecutive triple - double. The streak is now Westbrook's career - best and the longest by any player since Michael Jordan in 1989. Westbrook recently became the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple - double heading into the month of December. Sunday's performance marked Westbrook's tenth triple - double in 21 games this season. Aside from Westbrook, bench big man Enes Kanter thrived for the Thunder on Sunday, scoring 17 points and pulling down 10 rebounds while shooting 7 - of - 13. New Orleans big man Anthony Davis, meanwhile, expanded on his league - leading scoring average by pouring in 37 points against OKC. Davis added 15 rebounds, two steals, and four blocks. He saw little help from his teammates on Sunday, however. The rest of the Pelicans' starting five combined for just 25 points, and the team shot only 37 percent in the game.
