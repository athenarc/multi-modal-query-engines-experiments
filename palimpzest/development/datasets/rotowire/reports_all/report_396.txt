Thomas shot 14 - of - 25 including seven made three - pointers and added five rebounds and four assists on the night. Boston also saw strong play from All-Star center Al Horford, who toyed with the Charlotte frontcourt en route to an efficient 22 points in 34 minutes. After a season - best night in Atlanta on Friday, bench big man Kelly Olynyk came up huge once again, scoring 15 points to go with nine rebounds and four assists. The Celtics continued their barrage of three - point shooting, making 15 threes and shooting a flat 50 percent from the field on the night.
