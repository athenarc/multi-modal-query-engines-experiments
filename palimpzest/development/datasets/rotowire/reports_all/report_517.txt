The Dallas Mavericks (49 - 31) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (21 - 59) 120 - 106 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. It was another nice victory for the Mavericks, who have now extended their winning streak to three straight games. They're already locked in as the seventh seed in the Western Conference standings, so they'll look to continue to build their momentum with the playoffs on the verge of beginning. The Lakers have been eliminated from the playoffs for quite some time now, but the loss only helps their cause, as a worse record increases the potential for a higher landing spot for the 2015 NBA Draft. With the fourth worst record in the league, it's almost a sure thing they'll get a very high pick come draft day. The Mavericks were the superior shooters in this game, going 54 percent from the field and 48 percent from the three - point line, while the Lakers finished at 44 percent from the floor and 38 percent from deep. It was Tyson Chandler who surprisingly led the team in scoring. He went 9 - for - 10 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 20 points, while also adding nine rebounds and two blocked shots. The Lakers were just too young and inexperienced in their frontcourt, as Chandler was able to have a field day. It was just the fourth time all season that he reached the 20 - point mark, so it was easily one of his best offensive performances of the year. Richard Jefferson also gave a solid contribution. In 27 minutes as a starter, he finished with 17 points (4 - 7 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 7 - 9 FT) and three rebounds. He's shot very well over his last two games and has combined for 41 points during that span, so he'll look to keep his confidence high going into the playoffs. Dirk Nowitzki was the third starter in double figures, as he recorded 16 points (5 - 10 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and four rebounds. He's now averaging 19 points over his last seven games. Coming off the bench, Charlie Villanueva added 14 points (5 - 11 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and four rebounds, while Raymond Felton chipped in with 15 points (7 - 10 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt) and three assists. The Lakers production was very spread out through their lineup Sunday, with seven players reaching double - digit points. Jordan Clarkson led the way, finishing with a game - high of 26 points (9 - 19 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT), to go along with six assists and two steals. The rookie has been a very nice surprise for the Lakers so far this season, as he's averaged 21 points and 8 assists over his last four games. Clarkson received some help from Wesley Johnson though. Johnson went 6 - for - 9 from the field and 4 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score an efficient 16 points over 20 minutes. He had shot below 40 percent from the field in four out of his last five games coming into Sunday, so it was good to see him finally have some better success in this one. While it was n't his best game shooting the ball, Jabari Brown still posted 18 points (4 - 13 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 8 - 9 FT) and two assists over 42 minutes. He's combined for 38 points and nine assists over his last two games, moving his season averages to 10 points and 2 assists over 17 games with the Lakers. The Lakers' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Monday, while the Kings will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Monday.
