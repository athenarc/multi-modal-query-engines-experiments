The Los Angeles Clippers (53 - 26) held off the Los Angeles Lakers (20 - 57), 105 - 100, on Tuesday at the Staples Center. Tuesday's game was the second half of the Clippers and Lakers "home - and - home" set that started Sunday. The Clippers routed the Lakers 106 - 78 in that game, but Tuesday's game proved to be far more competitive. The Lakers hung close throughout Tuesday's contest thanks to rookie Jordan Clarkson's 20 point, six assist outing, but the Clippers' timely shooting helped seal their seventh straight victory over their cross - town rival. The Lakers have now dropped four straight and seven of their last nine overall. Jordan Clarkson shared ball handling duties with Jeremy Lin, who produced 14 points and five assists over 24 minutes on the floor. The Lakers will play the second half of a back - to - back set Wednesday when they travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets. The Clippers could ill - afford to drop a winnable game Tuesday after the Spurs tied their record with a blowout win over the Thunder. Despite some occasional sloppy play that allowed the Lakers to stay close, the Clippers took care of business to notch their 53rd win on the season. Jamal Crawford returned to the floor Tuesday after missing over a month with a calf injury. Crawford showed a some rust, finishing with just four points on 2 - of - 7 shooting in 19 minutes, but should be able to round back into form for the postseason. Chris Paul recorded 10 assists in the game, marking 25 total assists since his last turnover. The Clippers are off until Saturday when they host the Grizzlies in a matchup with potentially major playoff implications.
