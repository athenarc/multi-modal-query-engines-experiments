The Atlanta Hawks (5 - 3) defeated the Miami Heat (5 - 4) 114 - 103 on Friday. Atlanta has won four straight games, and they've been without starting small forward DeMarre Carroll (groin) for the last two games. Thabo Sefolosha has been filling in admirably in Carroll's stead. Sefolosha finished with 12 points Friday. He was one of eight Hawks players to finish with double - digit points. Miami is on a two - game losing streak, but their struggles against the Hawks were explainable with Dwyane Wade sitting out with a minor hamstring injury. James Ennis received the spot start in place of Wade, but it was Mario Chalmers off the bench who showed up big. He had a double - double with a team - high 23 points and 11 assists in 40 mintues. Wade is questionable to play in the Heat's next game Sunday at home against the Milwaukee Bucks. The Hawks will finish off their back - to - back set Saturday in Cleveland against the Cavaliers.
