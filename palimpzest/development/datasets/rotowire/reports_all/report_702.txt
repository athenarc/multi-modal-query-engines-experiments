The Boston Celtics (23 - 33) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (23 - 33) 106 - 98 Friday. Both teams are fighting for the final playoff spot in the East, but they also have competitions from the Pacers, Nets and Pistons. All five teams sit within a game of each other in the standings. Boston took the win Friday by limiting their turnovers while capitalizing on the Hornets' inability to do so. The Celtics scored 21 points off 16 turnovers but gave up only eight points on eight turnovers. Isaiah Thomas lead the Celtics' attack on offense, posting 28 points and seven assists in 31 minutes off the bench. Jonas Jerebko back Thomas' play, putting up his first double - double as a member of the Celtics with 16 points and 10 rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench. All five starters scored in double digits for the Hornets, and Mo Williams put in a game - high 31 points, but their good work shooting the from the field could n't make up for their inability to protect the ball. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist continued his inspired play of late, posting a second straight double - double and a fourth straight game scoring in double digits. He finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds in 32 minutes. Charlotte owns the season series with Boston, holding a 2 - 1 lead after Friday's game, and they'll meet on Mar. 30 for a game that could lead to one team making the playoffs and the other team going to the lottery. Boston will take Saturday off before hosting the Golden State Warriors on Sunday, and Charlotte will wrap up their four - game road trip Sunday against the Orlando Magic.
