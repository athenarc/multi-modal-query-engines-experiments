The Chicago Bulls (33 - 32) defeated the Toronto Raptors (44 - 21) in a potential playoff preview matchup Monday at Air Canada Centre, 109 - 107. The Bulls took a six - point lead into halftime and led 109 - 92 with 5:47 to play. It looked like they were going to coast to a victory until the final minute, when a Bulls lost ball turnover followed by a five - second violation opened the door for the Raptors, who closed it to 106 - 105 with 20 seconds to go. DeMar DeRozan had a chance to tie it in the game's final second, but Jimmy Butler blocked the layup attempt and Toronto's unlikely comeback bid fell just short. Doug McDermott hit four of his five three - point attempts as he came off the bench to lead the Bulls with 29 points (9 - 11 FG, 7 - 8 FT). E'Twaun Moore (8 - 11 FG) and Nikola Mirotic (5 - 12 FG, 3 - 8 3PT, 4 - 4 FT) led Chicago starters with 17 points apiece, and Taj Gibson notched a double - double with 13 points and 10 rebounds. The Bulls managed to shoot 49 percent from the floor despite missing Derrick Rose (left abductor strain) and Mike Dunleavy (stomach virus) from the lineup. Kyle Lowry's 33 points (10 - 20 FG, 2 - 5 3PT, 11 - 13 FT) led all scorers, and he filled up the box score with 11 rebounds, seven assists and three steals. DeRozan scored 27 and added five rebounds. The only other Raptor to reach double figures was Patrick Patterson with 13, however, as the team as a whole failed to find its shot. They made just 45 percent of their shots from the floor and shot 6 - 20 (30 percent) from beyond the arc. The Bulls continue their road trip Wednesday against the Wizzards. The Raptors head on the road Tuesday to face the Bucks.
