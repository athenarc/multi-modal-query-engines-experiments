The Atlanta Hawks (35 - 8) manhandled the Indiana Pacers (15 - 29), 110 - 91, on Wednesday. The Hawks continued their winning ways, emerging victorious for the 14th game in a row. Every starter and Pero Antic scored in double - digits, with Jeff Teague and DeMarre Carroll leading the way with 17 points apiece. Teague himself tallied his second double - double in three contests, dishing out 11 assists in the process. Falling just shy of his first double - double since last Wednesday, Jan. 14, Paul Millsap recorded 12 points, nine rebounds, and one three - pointer on the night. Speaking of the trey game, eight Hawks got in on the act, but Kyle Korver drilled a pair to bring his league - leading total to 130. In Atlanta's attempt to avoid only their third defeat since Nov. 26, their next test is a bit stiffer Friday against the Oklahoma City Thunder. On the other side, Indiana's season - long scoring slump continued. Shooting 40 percent from the field and a miserable 20 percent (5 - for - 25) from three - point range Wednesday, nary a Pacer found his groove offensively. While starting point man C.J. Watson managed 13 points, four rebounds, and three assists, the frontcourt trio of Roy Hibbert, David West, and Solomon Hill combined for 20 points and 14 rebounds. Nevertheless, C.J. Miles topped all teammates, notching 18 points (7 - 15 FG, 2 - 8 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) in 27 reserve minutes. Indiana will aim to snap a six - game losing skid Friday against former Eastern Conference nemesis, the Miami Heat.
