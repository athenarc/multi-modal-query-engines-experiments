Behind three 20 - point scorers, the Phoenix Suns (10 - 13) defeated the Orlando Magic (12 - 10) 107 - 104 Wednesday night at the Talking Stick Resort Arena. Despite trailing by 10 points with 4:18 to go in the game, the Magic roared back to tie it at 12 - 102 with 2:15 to go, fueld by seven quick points from Tobias Harris. But Phoenix guard Eric Bledsoe was n't having it, as he scored the final five points for the Suns to seal the victory. Bledsoe and Brandon Knight each led the Suns with 21 points. Alex Len knocked down 20 points on a clean 7 - 10 shooting night, blocked three shots, and notched a double - double with 14 rebounds. Mirza Teletovic knocked down four of his eight three - pointers on what was an otherwise dreadful deep shooting night for the Suns (6 - 24, 25 percent as a team on three - point shots), but their efficiency inside (35 - 56, 63 percent) was too tough for Orlando. Nikola Vucevic (8 - 16 shooting) led the Magic with 21 points and 11 rebounds, and Elfrid Payton notched his own double - double with 12 points and 10 assists. It was a solid offensive night for Orlando, as they rained down 12 three - pointers on 25 attempts, but their inability to stop Phoenix inside - - the Suns retrieved 11 offensive rebounds - - finished them. Orlando will try to get back to winning ways Friday at home against Cleveland. Phoenix next faces the Trail Blazers at home Friday night.
