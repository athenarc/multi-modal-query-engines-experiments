The Golden State Warriors defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers, 109 - 85, on Friday at Staple Center. This was the second game of a home - and - home series between the Lakers and Warriors that resulted in two wins for the Warriors. Golden State came out in the last game with an 80 - point first half as they looked to make a point against the team that had upset them early in the season. Since their loss to the Lakers early in the season, the Warriors have now won 10 games in a row, while setting a franchise - record with their 10th game with 30 assists or more. The Warriors (14 - 2) started off strong with a 30 - 20 first quarter. They tied the second quarter, with both teams scoring 23 but Golden State went on to dominate the final two quarters and cruise to victory. The win did come at a price though as Draymond Green left the game with an ankle tweak, and Ian Clark left after being accidentally hit in the throat. Meanwhile, Kevin Durant led the Warriors in scoring with 29 points, along with nine assists and six rebounds, in 33 minutes, while Stephen Curry added 24 points and Klay Thompson chipped in 18, as the three combined for a modest 71 points. The Warriors will have short rest before their next game in Minnesota on Saturday. The Lakers (8 - 9) were short - handed in this one, missing D'Angelo Russell (knee), Julius Randal (hip) and Nick Young (toe). Jordan Clarkson was the high - point man for Los Angeles, with 20 points, on 6 - of - 15 shooting, including 4 - of - 9 from deep, in 38 minutes. The only other players to score in double figures for the Lakers were Larry Nance Jr., with 11 and Lou Williams with 13. Los Angeles shot 36 percent from the field as a team and only 5 - of - 22 from deep as it was stifled by the Warriors. Next the Lakers play host to the Hawks on Sunday.
