The Chicago Bulls (31 - 30) defeated the Houston Rockets (30 - 32) 108 - 100 in All-Star Jimmy Butler's first game back from injury. Butler posted 24 points, 11 rebounds, and six assists to help lead the Bulls past the struggling Rockets. Butler was one of the NBA's hottest players in January before missing an extended period of time, allowing the Bulls to slip out of the Eastern Conference playoff picture. Butler was not the biggest story, however, as big man Pau Gasol led the team with 28 points and 17 rebounds. The star also notched pairs of blocks and steals on the defensive end, ultimately dominating the low post enough to push Chicago over the top on Saturday. 36 points from James Harden did n't make a difference on Saturday, as the Rockets fell to the faltering Bulls. The All-Star delivered five rebounds and eight assists as well, but could not compensate for the rest of his team's struggles. Center Dwight Howard in particular had issues, posting just eight points and being completely outmatched by the Bulls' Gasol. 2014 - 15's second seed now finds itself fighting to maintain a spot in the playoffs as the NBA reached its final stretch. The Rockets will visit Toronto on Sunday, while the Bulls will host Milwaukee on Monday.
