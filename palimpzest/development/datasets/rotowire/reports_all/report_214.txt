The Utah Jazz (34 - 36) dispatched the Milwaukee Bucks (30 - 40) Sunday at BMO Harris Bradley Center, 94 - 85. Utah held just a 43 - 42 lead after a tight first half, but the Jazz ended the quarter on a 26 - 8 run to carry a 14 - point lead into the fourth quarter. The Bucks went without a field goal for a 6:58 stretch in the period as their offense just could n't get revved up. Utah never trailed in the game's final period as they coasted to the victory. Gordon Hayward scored 18 points and hit three three - pointers to lead the Jazz. The Jazz also got double - doubles from Rudy Gobert with points 12 (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and 14 rebounds (six offensive) and Shelvin Mack with 13 points (5 - 11 FG) and 12 assists. Trey Lyles added 14 points in just 22 minutes off the bench as he also grabbed four rebounds and dished four assists. The Jazz were launching three - pointers all game, and managed to hit 13 of 37 attempts (35 percent). Jabari Parker of the Bucks finished with a game - high 19 points (8 - 14 FG) and added eight rebounds and a pair of assists. Khris Middleton (13 points) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (12 points, seven assists, four rebounds, two steals, two blocks) were the only other Bucks to even reach double - figures. The Bucks actually shot a solid 34 - 65 (52 percent) from the floor, but they managed just two offensive rebounds and hit only three three - point shots, and even their relatively efficient performance inside was n't enough to keep up with the Jazz's three - point barrage. The Jazz continue their road trip Wednesday in Houston. The Bucks head to Detroit for a Monday matchup against the Pistons.
