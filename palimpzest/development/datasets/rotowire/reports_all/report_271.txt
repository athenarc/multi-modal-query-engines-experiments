The Washington Wizards defeated the Indiana Pacers, 111 - 105, at Verizon Center on Wednesday. The Wizards (15 - 16) entered the fourth quarter with a seemingly comfortable 85 - 74 lead, and extend that edge to 87 - 74 early in the fourth after a Marcus Thornton layup in the opening minute. However, the Pacers (15 - 18) refused to go quietly, as they battled back throughout the quarter to eventually close the deficit to 100 - 98 with 1:54 remaining after a pair of Paul George free throws. That's as close as it would get, though, as Otto Porter drained a clutch three - pointer with 1:39 left, and John Wall, who led all scorers with 36 points, tallied the final six for Washington on a layup and two sets of free throws. The Pacers were led by George, who nearly matched Wall point for point with 34 points (10 - 20 FG, 6 - 10 3Pt), four assists, three rebounds and a steal. Jeff Teague bounced back from one of his poorer shooting nights of the season with a 19 - point, 11 - assist double - double that also included a pair of rebounds and a steal. Myles Turner compiled 15 points and eight rebounds, along with a trio of blocks. Thaddeus Young filled out the stat sheet with 11 points, six rebounds, three assists and a game - high six steals. C.J. Miles provided his typically solid contribution off the bench with 15 points, three rebounds and an assist. Wall added 11 rebounds, nine assists and a pair of steals for a spectacular stat line overall. Porter scored 22 points overall, which he supplemented with a rebound. Marcin Gortat stepped up with a 13 - point, 16 - rebound double - double that also included four assists and a steal. Bradley Beal compiled 12 points, two assists, a rebound and a pair of steals, but he was limited to just 18 minutes due to a sprained right ankle suffered in the contest. Markieff Morris supplied 10 points, seven boards, an assist and a steal. The Pacers return home for a Friday date with the Chicago Bulls, while the Wizards host the Brooklyn Nets on Friday evening as well.
