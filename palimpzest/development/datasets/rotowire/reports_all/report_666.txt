The Memphis Grizzlies (13 - 10) defeated the Detroit Pistons (12 - 11) Wednesday 93 - 92 at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit. The Pistons thought they had this game won. Up three with 30 seconds remaining and the Grizzlies struggling to score over the final few minutes of the game, a victory was in their grasp. However, with the Grizzlies down just two following Marcus Morris missed jumper with five seconds left, Matt Barnes grabbed the rebound, dribbled the length of the floor and threw up a long 31 - foot three with under two seconds left. Memphis had won. While Barnes ended up being the hero, it was the efforts of Zach Randolph that carries the Grizzlies through the game, as he finished with a monster double - double of 21 points and 16 points in 35 minutes. Marc Gasol added a double - double of his own, finishing with 19 points and 12 rebounds. Mike Conley (11) and Courtney Lee (14) were the only other Memphis players to score in double figures. For the Pistons, it was another night and another Andre Drummond double - double, as he finished with 18 points and a game - high 19 rebounds in 37 minutes. Reggie Jackson matched Drummondâ€™s 18 points and dished out seven assists, while Morris scored 16 points. Steven Blake scored a surprising 11 points in just 16 minutes off the bench. Up next, the Grizzlies will head home Friday to take on the Hornets, while the Pistons will travel to Philadelphia to play the 76ers.
