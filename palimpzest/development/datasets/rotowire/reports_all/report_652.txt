The San Antonio Spurs (42 - 8) defeated the Dallas Mavericks (28 - 25) 116 - 90 on Friday. This game got out of hand early. San Antonio led 62 - 26 at halftime and dominated in nearly every statistic. Most notably was the shooting, as the Spurs hit 51 percent of their shots, while the Mavericks made 45 percent of theirs. Dallas actually scored 64 points in the second half, so those numbers look much better than they actually were. The turnover differential was huge as well, with San Antonio nearly doubling them up in that stat at the half. The three - point shooting killed Dallas, as they went 3 - for - 15 with the Spurs going 12 - for - 22 on their end. San Antonio has had many of these garbage time games and it shows just how powerful this Spurs team is. Kawhi Leonard led the team with 23 points and did that in under 27 minutes of play. LaMarcus Aldridge continued his recent strong play, as he double - doubled in the blowout. The bench scored 58 points in the win and brought eight players off the pine. The rest for the starters was good news, as the Spurs play the second half of a back - to - back on Saturday against the Los Angeles Lakers. Dallas has been competitive in nearly every game this season, but this was not one of those games. The Mavericks bench nearly doubled up the scoring of the starters, as mop - up time started very early. No player on the team scored more than 13 points, with Justin Anderson and Charlie Villanueva tying foe the team - lead. Luckily for Dallas, they play again on Saturday against the Memphis Grizzlies and can forget about this game as soon as possible.
