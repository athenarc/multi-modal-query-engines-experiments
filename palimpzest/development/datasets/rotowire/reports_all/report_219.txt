The benches for both the Dallas Mavericks and the Houston Rockets were instrumental in keeping both teams in the game, but no one player finished with any astronomical numbers, save for J.J. Barea. Barea chimed in with 18 points, five assists and three rebounds, and included a strong 75 percent shooting from behind the arc. The rest of the Mavericks bench attack was led by Justin Anderson and Dwight Powell, who combined for 15 points and five boards. The Rockets spread their bench out with most of the rotation seeing around 15 minutes of play. Nene Hilario added 11 points to counteract Clint Capelaâ€™s four points but was less effective on the boards. Second-year Wisconsin product Sam Dekker went 3 - of - 3 from deep and added nine points in minutes of action in the winning effort.
