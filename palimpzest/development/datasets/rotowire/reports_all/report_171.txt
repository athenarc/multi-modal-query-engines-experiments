The Boston Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 90 - 83, at TD Garden on Wednesday. The Mavericks (2 - 8) checked into Wednesday scoring the third - least points per game in the league (95), and that trend would rear its ugly head yet again against a Boston squad that was ranked in the bottom 10 in points allowed. Playing once again without Dirk Nowitzki (Achilles), Dallas got precious little production from anyone not named Harrison Barnes or Wesley Matthews. The two players combined for just over 60 percent of the team's point total, and the Mavs managed just a 42 percent success rate from the field overall. Meanwhile, although the Celtics (6 - 5) did n't have much more offensive balance on their end, they benefited greatly from a game - high 30 points from Isaiah Thomas, with 22 of those coming in the fourth quarter. Barnes led Dallas with 28 points, but could n't contribute much else in the non - scoring categories, posting two rebounds, an assist and two steals. Matthews drained six - of - 13 three - point attempts on his way to 22 points, and he added three rebounds and two steals. Deron Williams notably was scoreless over 10 minutes in his return from a multi - game absence due to a calf injury, while J.J. Barea paced the reserves with nine points, six assists, two rebounds and a steal over 28 minutes in his stead. Both Williams and Barea had to leave the game with injuries and were unable to return. Thomas added six dimes and four rebounds to his scoring total. Avery Bradley posted an 18 - point, 13 - rebound double - double that also included an assist. Kelly Olynyk drew another start in place of Al Horford (concussion) at power forward, totaling 10 points and four boards over 29 minutes. Amir Johnson filled out the stat sheet with eight points, six rebounds, four assists and two steals. The Mavericks head back home to face the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday, while the Celtics have their own Friday showdown at home against the Golden State Warriors.
