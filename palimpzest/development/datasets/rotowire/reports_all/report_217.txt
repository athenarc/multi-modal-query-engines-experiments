The Dallas Mavericks (15 - 5) went on the road and knocked off the Milwaukee Bucks (10 - 10) 107 - 105 on Wednesday night at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. It was Monta Ellis once again who led the way for the Mavericks. After a double - overtime thriller against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday where Ellis scored 38 points, he led the team in scoring 23 points (11 - 26 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) to go with seven assists and three steals. No bucket was bigger than his fadeaway game - winner though. Ellis has been on fire lately, but he got plenty of help on Wednesday, as six players scored in double figures. Tyson Chandler scored 18 points (8 - 11 FG, 2 - 6 FT) to go with 20 rebounds. To make the win even more impressive, the Mavs decided to rest Dirk Nowitzki on Wednesday. The Bucks just could n't do enough to knock off the Mavericks on this night, as only three players scored in double figures. While the Bucks out - shot the Mavericks, hitting 52 percent from the field and 64 percent from behind the three - point line, it still was n't enough. Milwaukee got an impressive 25 points from Brandon Knight (8 - 16 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 7 FT), who also put up six rebounds, five assists and four steals. Khris Middleton led the bench with 30 minutes played, and produced nicely, adding 21 points (8 - 13 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) to go with eight rebounds, three steals and one block. The Bucks have been up and down all year, as is evident from their 10 - 10 record.
