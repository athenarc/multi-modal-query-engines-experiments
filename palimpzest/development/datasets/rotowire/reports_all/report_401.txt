On Friday, veteran Maverick Dirk Nowitzki returned from injury in surprisingly big fashion. Despite being limited to just 15 minutes on the floor, Nowitzki scored 17 points and shot 7 - of - 12. Forward Harrison Barnes, meanwhile, scored a team - high 24 points and shot an impressive 11 - of - 19. The team shot only 42 percent on the night, but was able to make up for it with strong defensive play. The Mavericks were able to force 20 Clippers turnovers by the end of the night. Los Angeles felt the absence of All-Star Blake Griffin on Friday, as the team's starting five scored just 34 points combined. Superstar Chris Paul also sat out the game, leaving little in the way of offensive production for Los Angeles. Sixth man Jamal Crawford did provide some start, contributing 26 points off the bench.
