Joel Embiid insured the Sixers' second straight foray into overtime against the Pacers paid off, tallying 25 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a block. He sank two key free throws with eight seconds remaining, providing the four - point cushion that would be the final margin of victory. Gerald Henderson (12 points) and Robert Covington (10 points) tallied double - digit scoring, while Ersan Ilyasova and T.J. McConnell contributed a pair of 14 - point efforts off of the bench. Paul George's 26 points led the Pacers, despite a temporary first - half exit with a thumb sprain. Monta Ellis totaled 19 points off the bench, although it did come over a robust 36 minutes. A trio of complementary double - digit scoring efforts from the starting five (Jeff Teague, C.J. Miles and Thaddeus Young) helped round out the leading offensive efforts for Indiana.
