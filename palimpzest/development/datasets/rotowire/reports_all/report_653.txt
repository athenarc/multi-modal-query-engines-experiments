The Los Angeles Clippers (5 - 2) just squeezed by with a win on Monday night versus the Memphis Grizzlies (3 - 5) by a score of 94 - 92. This gritty, grind - it - out game came right down to the wire, as Marc Gasol missed a free throw in the last few seconds that would have tied the game after a very late Grizzlies rally. Neither team had much help off the bench, as this game was primarily a battle of two of the league's best starting frontcourts. Zach Randolph led the Grizzlies in scoring and rebounding, with 26 points and nine boards. He added four assists and three steals in 39 minutes. Gasol added 18 points, seven rebounds, and three assists. Mike Conley gave the Grizzlies good guard play with 16 points, six rebounds, five assists, and one steal, but did n't have much help in terms of backcourt scoring. Courtney Lee had only six points, but still dished five assists and grabbed three steals. Matt Barnes had a bit of a chip on his shoulder after being let go by the Clippers and played hard against his old team, tallying eight points, six rebounds, two steals and two blocks. The frontcourt combo of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan proved superior in this Western Conference showdown. Griffin had a solid game with 24 points and 12 rebounds, while Jordan scored 13 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. Jordan also added four blocks. Chris Paul and J.J. Redick both contributed double - digit scoring, with Paul providing 14 points and Redick supplying 16. Up next for Memphis will be a match with the undefeated Golden State Warriors. The Clippers will be at Dallas on Wednesday to face the Mavs.
