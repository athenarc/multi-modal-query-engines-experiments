Though the New Orleans Pelicans (0 - 2) made a late fourth quarter push to come back from a 30 - point deficit, they ultimately fell short Wednesday against the Trail Blazers, losing to the home team by a 112 - 94 count. Despite having starting point guard Jrue Holiday back for Wednesday’s game after he rested during Tuesday’s loss to the Golden State Warriors, the Pelicans still quickly found themselves in an immediate hole. They trailed 43 - 18 after one quarter, and 70 - 43 at the half, while looking about as inept as possible on both ends of the court. Much of the team’s struggles were a byproduct of their mounting injury list, which again forced Anthony Davis to see heightened defensive attention. He would rebound from a slow start to finish with 25 points in 40 minutes, to go along with 10 rebounds, and a pair of blocks and steals. Of course, the Trail Blazers had a hand in the Pelicans’ demise, and New Orleans’ chief source of anguish was C.J. McCollum. After Stephen Curry lit the Pelicans up for 24 points in the first quarter of Tuesday’s game, McCollum responded with a 22 - point effort in the first quarter. He would finish the night with a career - high 37 points, while Damian Lillard chipped in with 21 points and 11 assists. The Blazers will play their second game of the season in Phoenix on Friday, while the Pelicans will head back to New Orleans for a rematch Saturday with the Warriors.
