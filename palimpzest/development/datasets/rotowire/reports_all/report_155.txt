The Charlotte Hornets (36 - 28) defeated the visiting Detroit Pistons (33 - 32) 118 - 103, Friday evening at Time Warner Cable Arena. The Hornets led the whole way in this one, after a very strong, 69 - 53 first half. The Pistons fought back, bringing it to a five - point game late in the third, but could never gain the lead. With this win the Hornets have now won six in a row for the first time in six seasons, and have also won seven in a row at home, where their record is now a solid 24 - 9. The Pistons came into this one winners of their last two games but had their win streak cut short, and their grip on eighth in the East loosened, as they came in only half a game ahead of Chicago. Kemba Walker was relatively quiet as he failed to record 30 points, a feat which he accomplished in his four previous games. Instead, Walker finished with 16 points (3 - 11 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 9 - 9 FT), eight assists, one rebound and one steal, in 32 minutes. Six other players scored in double digits for the Hornets, more than compensating for Walker's quiet game. Marvin Williams was the high - point man for Charlotte, as he finished with 22 points (7 - 12 FG, 5 - 8 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), along with six rebounds, in 25 minutes. Nicolas Batum logged a double - double as he added 17 points and 11 assists, along with five rebounds and two steals, in 37 minutes. The Hornets did a good job at the foul line, hitting 24 - 29 free throws and shot a solid 51 percent from the field and 40 percent from deep. Reggie Jackson had a strong game for Detroit, finishing with 20 points (7 - 15 FG, 2 - 9 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), 10 assists and two rebounds, in 31 minutes. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 24 points (9 - 16 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), in 38 minutes, while Tobias Harris chipped in 20 points (6 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), five rebounds, three steals and one assist, in 34 minutes. Stanley Johnson made his return to the lineup after being out with a shoulder injury that he suffered on February 22nd. Johnson logged nine minutes, during which he contributed three points (1 - 1 3Pt). Next, the Pistons head straight to Philly to play the third game of their current four - game road trip, on Saturday. The Hornets will look to extend their overall win streak and also their home win streak as they host the Rockets on Saturday.
