The Golden State Warriors (25 - 1) took care of the Phoenix Suns (11 - 16) 128 - 103 on Wednesday to rebound after their first loss. The Warriors looked timid for the first 20 minutes of the game, but turned it on after that. They trailed for the majority of the first half, until Steph Curry caught fire and the team won the second quarter by 15 points. The most amazing stat is that the Warriors scored 79 points in the second and third quarters to run away with a dominant victory. Golden State shot an amazing 52 percent from the field and recorded 32 assists in the blowout victory. The Suns first meeting with the Warriors was a similar result and they simply ca n't stop this potent offense. Aside from Brandon Knight's 17 points, the other four starters combined for just 19 points. The bench did play well though, as Mirza Teletovic provided 24 points and T.J. Warren scored 19. The team has won just four games in their last 15 and the defense is really killing them right now. The Suns will look to play better in their next game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday. Steph Curry sat for the ninth time this season in the entirety of the fourth quarter and that stat alones tells the dominance of this team. Prior to sitting for the final 12 minutes, Curry tallied 25 points and seven assists. He wasnâ€™t the hero tonight though, as Klay Thompson dropped 27 points in the third quarter en route to a 43 - point night. Draymond Green also provided yet another triple - double and it appears that one loss was a blip on the radar rather than a sign of future struggles. It's scary to think what they'll do to the Milwaukee Bucks in their next game on Friday, who ended their historic streak earlier in the week.
