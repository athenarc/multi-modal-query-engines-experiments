The Phoenix Suns (23 - 59) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (53 - 29) 114 - 105 at Talking Stick Arena on Wednesday. The Clippers strategically rested Blake Griffin, Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan, as their playoff seeding is locked in and neither a win or loss would have changed that outcome. The Suns, on the other hand, were looking to close out the season with a win for the hometown fans, and also had little draft positioning to worry about. Seven Suns players finished in double figures, but it was yet another strong performance from Mirza Teletovic, who finished with 22 points to lead the team in scoring alongside nine rebounds and two assists. Jon Leuer was strong on the glass and contributed 16 points and 14 boards, while Alan Williams saw increased playing time off the bench and capitalized on the opportunity. Williams scored 14 points, grabbed 12 rebounds and picked up a steal in 22 minutes of action. Jeff Greene and CJ Wilcox were the leaders off the bench for the Clippers, and combined for 38 points on 15 - of - 29 shooting. Pablo Prigioni and Austin Rivers started in the backcourt and the additional minutes will likely aid the Clippers as they head into the playoffs with the 4 - seed. Both players eclipsed 30 minutes of action, but played a rather slow paced game on their way to 24 combined points. The Clippers will meet the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs, while the Suns will look to rebuild in the offseason.
