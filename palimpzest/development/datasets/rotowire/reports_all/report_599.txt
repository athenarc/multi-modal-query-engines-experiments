The host Denver Nuggets cruised past the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, 129 - 109. It was smooth sailing for Denver (26 - 32), who earned a bounce - back win after falling to the Kings on Thursday night. Like Thursday night, however, star Denver center Nikola Jokic was a complete non - factor. The 21 - year - old played only 14 minutes and picked up four fouls while scoring only two points. A big night from Jokic was n't necessary for Denver's success, though, as three Nuggets scored at least 20 points on the night. The team's high - scorer was shooting guard Gary Harris, who posted 25 points. Overall, Denver shot a stellar 50 percent from the field including 14 three - pointers and held a nine - rebound advantage on the glass. Brooklyn (9 - 48), meanwhile, appears far from getting back on track. While injuries to key players such as Jeremy Lin have played a role, the Nets have simply performed at a low level throughout the season. Brooklyn has now lost 15 consecutive games and remains significantly behind in the Eastern Conference standings. On Friday, the team saw a fairly respectable offensive night but a miserable defensive one. The Nets shot over 49 percent but were outscored by 20. A big issue for Brooklyn was turnovers, as the team coughed the ball up 19 times on the night. The Nets will visit Golden State on Saturday, while Denver will host the Grizzlies on Sunday.
