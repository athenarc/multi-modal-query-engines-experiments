The Dallas Mavericks (48 - 31) defeated the Denver Nuggets (29 - 50) 144 - 143 in double overtime on Friday in Denver. Dallas blew a 23 - point lead Friday, but in the end, it was reserve guard Raymond Felton who took Randy Foye one - on - one on the Mavericks' final offensive possession to score the game - winning layup with 2 seconds left. Felton also had the game - ending defensive stop on Nuggets big man Kennth Faried. There was very little defense and a whole lot of offense in a game where Dallas had nothing to play for but pride, given that they are locked in as the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. Given that and the length of the game, most of the starters for the Mavericks were rested for both overtime periods. Despite this, Dirk Nowitzki was still able to score 25 points (10 - 19 FG) and grab nine rebounds in 28 minutes, while Richard Jefferson was close behind, scoring 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt) in 31 minutes. Devin Harris also played well off the bench, scoring 21 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 3 3Pt) and dishing out nine assists in 29 minutes. Both Chandler Parsons (knee) and Rajon Rondo (rest) sat out of Friday's contest. Danilo Gallinari was absolutely on fire in the losing effort for the Nuggets, scoring 47 points on a scorching 15 - of - 23 shooting from the field, 7 - of - 12 from three and 10 - 10 from the free throw line in 46 minutes. Gallinari's 47 points is the most scored by a Denver player since Carmelo Anthony dropped 50 in 2011. Ty Lawson also had a monster game, scoring 19 points (8 - 21 FG) and dishing out 18 assists in a game - high 52 minutes. Wilson Chandler also posted a double - double of 20 points and 11 rebounds. Randy Foye (17) and Kenneth Faried (14) round out all five starters who scored in double figures, while J.J. Hickson scored 14 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench. Up next, the Mavericks will travel to Los Angeles Sunday to take on the Lakers, while the Nuggets while stay home and play the Kings on Sunday.
