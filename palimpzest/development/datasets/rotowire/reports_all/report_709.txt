In a close contest, the Chicago Bulls (38 - 37) earned a much - needed 103 - 100 win against the host Houston Rockets (37 - 39). With their playoff hopes starting to wane, Chicago will need a solid end to its season in order to achieve postseason berth. Still a game behind their rival Indiana Pacers, the Bulls have spent weeks on the outside of the playoff picture looking in. Thursday's win may keep the team's playoff hopes alive, as the squad was able to scrape by against the similarly - situated Rockets. All-Star Jimmy Butler took control for Chicago, racking up 21 points to go with eight rebounds and six assists. Bench big man Nikola Mirotic, meanwhile, exploded for 28 points in what proved to be a valuable contribution to Chicago's winning effort. Chicago's stellar 48 percent from the field was a key factor in establishing a lead at the game's end. Houston, meanwhile, sits just half a game out of playoff contention despite the loss. After making last year's Western Conference Finals, the Rockets have seen a tremendous drop - off, now sitting below .500. On Thursday, the backcourt of Patrick Beverly and James Harden combined for 46 points. Beverly also notched seven assists without a single turnover in one of his biggest performances of the season. It was n't enough for the win, however, as the team shot a dismal 40 percent from the field as a whole. With the season entering its final stretch, it will take some winning basketball to get Houston back on track for the playoffs. The Bulls will play the Pistons on Sunday, while the Rockets will take on the Thunder on Monday.
