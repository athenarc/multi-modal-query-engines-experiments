The Brooklyn Nets (16 - 42) defeated the host Phoenix Suns (14 - 44) 116 - 106, Thursday night at Talking Stick Resort Arena. The Suns and the Nets represent two of the worst records in the NBA this season. With this result Phoenix suffered its 13th straight loss, tying a franchise - high. This loss also marked a franchise - high eighth - straight home loss for the Suns. Although they are far out of the playoff race, the Nets have been playing slightly better as of late, winning four of their last eight games, after a horrible stretch during which they lost 15 of 17. The Nets waived Joe Johnson early on Thursday, which gave some of their younger players a chance to showcase their skills in this contest and they did just that. Bojan Bogdanovic recorded a career - high 24 points (8 - 16 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT), in 38 minutes, while Markel Brown chipped in 16 points (4 - 7 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 6 - 8 FT), along with three rebounds, one assist and one steal, in 24 minutes off the bench. Thaddeus Young also stepped it up as he finished with 18 points (8 - 11 FG, 2 - 2 FT), eight rebounds, seven steals, three assists and three blocked shots, in 36 minutes. Despite giving up 18 turnovers, the Nets played well offensively, shooting 49 percent from the field, 44 percent from long range and hitting 34 - of - 42 free throws. Phoenix did not do a good job of controlling the ball and establishing rhythm as they gave up 21 turnovers and recorded only 16 assists on 42 made field goals. Mirza Teletovic stood out as a bright spot for the Suns, as he tallied 30 points (12 - 23 FG, 5 - 13 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), along with 11 rebounds, in 30 minutes off the bench. Tyson Chandler recorded 12 points (5 - 9 FG, 2 - 4 FT), 11 rebounds, two steals, one assist and one block, in 33 minutes, after missing two games with a sore shoulder. Alex Len chipped in 13 points (5 - 10 FG, 3 - 7 FT) and six rebounds, in 17 minutes. Len's status for this game was in question after he twisted his ankle in practice on Wednesday. The Suns battled back after entering the fourth down - 19, to bring it as close as 10, a difference their 13 missed free throws would have more than settled. The Suns will host the Grizzlies on Saturday, and will look to avoid setting a single - season, franchise - high 14th straight loss. The Nets will move on to Utah to play the Jazz on Saturday, in what will be their third game of a nine - game road trip.
