At 25 years old, it seems Kawhi Leonard is experience statistical growth in almost every category. With 29 on Friday, Leonard is now averaging 29 points per game through his first six contests. He is also averaging a career - high four assists per game through the first six contests. While both numbers are impressive for the two - time Defensive Player of the Year, it seems that where Leonard is exerting the most statistical dominance is the free - throw line. Kawhi went a perfect 10 - for - 10 from the line on Friday, and has now missed just two of his 55 free - throw attempts on the season. As the season continues, it will be seen if Leonard's significant growth in most box score columns is sustainable. It was a tale of two teams from the free - throw line on Friday, as the Spurs (with Leonard's assistance) shot over 90 percent from the charity stripe. Utah, meanwhile, did not fare as well, hitting just 65 percent of their attempts at the line.
