The Sacramento Kings (22 - 31) earned a road win Wednesday at Wells Fargo Center over the Philadelphia 76ers (8 - 45), 114 - 110. The 76ers led for the vast majority of the game and stretched their lead to as much as 16 early in the third quarter. But the Kings managed to hang around enough to let their starters make a run late in the fourth quarter. Trailing by six with 3:44 to go, Rajon Rondo made a layup that sparked an 11 - 2 run to give the Kings a lead they would n't relinquish. DeMarcus Cousins led the Kings with 28 points (8 - 18 FG, 12 - 17 FT) and 12 rebounds for his third double - double in the past five games. Darren Collison had a huge game off the bench, as he poured in 25 points (9 - 12 FG, 2 - 2 3PT, 5 - 6 FT) and turned the ball over just once in 32 minutes. Rudy Gay scored 22 and Rajon Rondo added 14 points with a game - high 15 assists as the Kings managed to win despite shooting just 4 - 16 (25 percent) from three. Robert Covington drained seven of his 11 three - point attempts en route to a game - high 29 points, just part of a three - point barrage from the 76ers, who shot 15 - 34 (44 percent) from deep. Jahlil Okafor scored 26 points working inside (11 - 18 FG, 4 - 5 FT) and added 10 rebounds, five assists and two blocks, and Nik Stauskas scored 16 behind a 4 - 5 effort from three. But the 76ers turned it over 19 times and allowed 26 points off those turnovers, dooming them despite their hot shooting. The Kings return home next Friday for a matchup with the Nuggets. The 76ers will take to the road to face the Pelicans next Friday.
