The Toronto Raptors (38 - 18) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (18 - 40) 114 - 105, on Wednesday night at Air Canada Center. The Raptors avoided a second collapse against the Timberwolves this season by clamping down in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves overcame an 18 - point deficit on February 10th, to defeat the Raptors in Minnesota but the Raptors would not allow a repeat, especially not on their home turf, where their record is now a solid 20 - 6. This was the Raptors third win in a row and marked a franchise - tying ninth straight home victory for Toronto. The Raptors led by as many as nine in the fourth quarter before Minnesota tied it up at 101 with 3:48 to go. This all too familiar circumstance must have ignited Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, who went into clutch mode, hitting two three - pointers each, combining for 12 points in the last three and a half minutes. Lowry really helped Toronto get over the hump in this one as he scored 12 of his 21 points (6 - 14 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) in the final quarter. Lowry also tallied six assists and three rebounds, in 39 hard fought minutes. DeMar DeRozan poured in a game - high 31 points (11 - 19 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT), along with four rebounds, four assists and two steals, in 38 minutes. Cory Joseph finished with 18 points (6 - 8 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 5 - 8 FT), six assists and two rebounds in 22 minutes off the bench. Andrew Wiggins led the Timberwolves with a team - high 26 points (9 - 19 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 6 - 9 FT), along with four rebounds and three assists. He did however give up an unsightly six turnovers, in his 32 minutes on the floor. Ricky Rubio logged a double - double with 12 points and 12 assists, along with three rebounds and two steals, in 36 minutes, while Gorgui Dieng chipped in 21 points (8 - 9 FG, 5 - 6 FT), eight rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal. Dieng played 41 minutes, as he started in place of Kevin Garnett, who sat out with a sore knee. Karl-Anthony Towns, who has averaged 24 points and 13 rebounds in his last six games was relatively quiet, as he finished with 16 points and six rebounds, in 37 minutes. Next, the Timberwolves will visit New Orleans to face - off against the Pelicans on Saturday. The Raptors will host the Cavaliers on Friday, in what will be a showdown between the top two teams in the East.
