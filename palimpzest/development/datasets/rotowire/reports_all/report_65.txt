The Atlanta Hawks (46 - 32) defeated the Phoenix Suns (20 - 59) Tuesday night at Phillips Arena, 103 - 90. Phoenix exploded to a 10 - point lead with a 38 - point first quarter and entered halftime with a 12 - point lead. But the Suns offense could n't maintain the pace, as they could n't reach 20 points in any of the final three quarters. The Hawks chipped away throughout the second half. Atlanta opened the fourth quarter on a 12 - 2 run to turn a 73 - 70 deficit into an 82 - 75 lead, and they would n't give it up. Jeff Teague's 20 points led the Hawks as he knocked down three of his seven three - point attempts. The Hawks got double - doubles from Paul Millsap (13 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists) and Al Horford (16 points, 10 rebounds). Kent Bazemore nearly added a third, as he poured in 17 points (7 - 13 FG, 2 - 5 3PT), grabbed nine rebounds, dished five assists and swiped five steals. Atlanta shot just 41 percent from the floor, but they were active both on the offensive glass (13 offensive rebounds) and in the passing lanes (16 steals), and that allowed them to nab the win despite lacking their shooting touch. Devin Booker made the Suns offense go, as he scored a game - high 34 points on a ludicrously efficient 12 - 25 shooting night, including 4 - 9 from deep. Booker added five rebounds, two assists and two steals and turned the ball over just twice despite using over 30 possessions. He got little help, though, as Ronnie Price was Phoenix's second leading scorer with 14 points (4 - 9 FG, 4 - 7 3PT). Price committed seven turnovers, however, and the Suns were sloppy all night, as Phoenix committed 24 turnovers and managed just 19 assists. The Hawks continue their homestand Thursday against the Raptors. The Suns continue their road trip Thursday against the Rockets.
