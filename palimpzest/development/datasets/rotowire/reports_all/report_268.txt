If it was n't already the case before, Lou Williams has firmly established himself as the Lakers best offensive weapon over the past month or so. Following his 21 points in 24 minutes Wednesday against the Suns, Williams is averaging 24 points over his last three games and has shot over 50 percent in each of those contests. In fact, Williams, who is known as a high - volume shooter, has managed to remain very efficient as of late, shooting over 50 percent from the field in seven of his last 10 games. Overall, Wednesday's performance marked the 16th time this season where Williams scored at least 20 points while shooting over 50 percent from the field. The veteran's remarkable season may now lead to trade talks, as the Lakers look to continue to build a young core for the future.
