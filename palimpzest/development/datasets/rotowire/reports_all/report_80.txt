The Oklahoma City Thunder (21 - 10) defeated the Denver Nuggets (12 - 19) 122 - 112 on Sunday night. The final scoreline indicates a double - digit win, but the game was tight throughout. In fact, Denver had an eight - point lead going into the half, but allowed 69 second half points en route to a tough loss. This was far from a defensive struggle, as the Thunder shot an astounding 58 percent from the field while the Nuggets shot 49 percent. Denver came into this game as a 17 - point underdog and did well for themselves in a close loss. They played very good offense, but just didn’t do enough defensively to win the game. Kenneth Faried had one of his best games of the season, as he collected 25 points and 11 rebounds. Denver actually had five players score at least 15 points, but had no player dish out more than five assists. Will Barton had another nice game off the bench as well, as he tallied 19 points, five rebounds and five assists in the defeat. It goes down as a loss in the record book, but it was a productive game from team who was expected to get blown out. It doesn’t get much easier in their next game though, as they host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday in their next game. The Thunder have been playing some spectacular ball as of late and they appear unbeatable at home. They are now 14 - 4 at the Chesapeake Arena and scoring at will. Both Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were on point tonight and once again carried them to a win. Westbrook flirted with a triple - double, as he amassed 30 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, while Durant totaled 26 points, 10 assists and five rebounds. When these two are playing like that, this is one of the three best teams in the NBA. Enes Kanter also had a great game off the bench, tallying 21 points and eight rebounds on an efficient 7 - of - 8 shooting from the field and from the free - throw line. Oklahoma City will look to build off this win when they host the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday.
