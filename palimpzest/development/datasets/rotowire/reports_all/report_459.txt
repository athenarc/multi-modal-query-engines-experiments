The Oklahoma City Thunder (23 - 22) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (7 - 37) 92 - 84 on Monday at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City. Neither team shot very well in this matchup, but the Thunder still had the slight advantage, going 42 percent from the field and 20 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves went just 34 percent from the floor and a meager 15 percent from beyond the arc. The Thunder were able to use a strong first half, out - scoring the Timberwolves 48 - 40, giving them enough of an advantage to secure the victory in front of their home crowd. With Kevin Durant sitting out with a sprained toe, Russell Westbrook did most of the shooting Monday, going 7 - for - 22 from the field to score 18 points in 30 minutes. It may not have been his best performance shooting the ball, but it was still enough to push the Thunder to a victory. Westbrook is averaging 24 points over his last four games. Serge Ibaka had a strong showing as well, scoring 13 points (6 - 13 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt) and grabbing a ridiculous 19 rebounds. The double - double was his third in a row, while the 19 rebounds were a new season - high. The Thunder got a lot of help from their bench though. Both Anthony Morrow (5 - 13 FG, 1 - 7 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) and Reggie Jackson (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) scored 14 points, while Dion Waiters added 10 (4 - 12 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 4 FT) points. Thaddeus Young and Andrew Wiggins were the biggest reasons that the Timberwolves were able to stay competitive in this game. Young had 22 points (8 - 20 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and eight rebounds, while Wiggins had 23 points (7 - 14 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 9 - 12 FT), four rebounds and two steals. Young has had an impressive couple of games in a row, combining for 48 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists over that span. He's starting to find his groove, after not living up to expectations so far this season. The only other Timberwolve's player to reach double figures in points was Zach LaVine, who came off the bench for 11 points (3 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT) and five rebounds. Gorgui Dieng did n't have his best showing offensively with only six points, but he was still an animal on the boards, recording 18 rebounds in 35 minutes. The Thunder's next game will be on the road against the New York Knicks on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will be at home against the Boston Celtics on Wednesday.
