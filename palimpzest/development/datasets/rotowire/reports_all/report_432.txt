The San Antonio Spurs (5 - 3) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (1 - 8) 93 - 80 on Friday. San Antonio has won three straight games. Every team on the Spurs' schedule through their first eight games is a projected playoff team, excluding the Lakers of course. Their schedule begins to loosen up some in the next couple weeks with the Spurs facing several lottery - bound teams. Los Angeles could n't do anything on offense against the Spurs. The Lakers shot 37 percent from the field and 17 percent from beyond the arc. Kobe Bryant shot just 1 - for - 14 from the field to finish with a season - low nine points. The Spurs will finish off their current four - game roadtrip Saturday against the Kings in Sacramento. Los Angeles has a day off before hosting the Golden State Warriors on Sunday.
