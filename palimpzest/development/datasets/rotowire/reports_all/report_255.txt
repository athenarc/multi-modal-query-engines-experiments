The Indiana Pacers (39 - 34) snagged a close 104 - 101 win over the Houston Rockets (36 - 38) on Sunday in an Easter afternoon matchup. The Pacers saw big scoring performances from top - notch scorers Paul George and Monta Ellis. The duo posted 25 and 23 respectively, with George also snatching 11 rebounds on the night. Rookie big man Myles Turner also showed off, coming up with 11 rebounds to go with 19 points on impressive 8 - for - 12 shooting. Indiana shot 47 percent as a squad, a respectable mark that was enough to lift them to narrow victory. The Pacers are now half a game ahead of the Pistons in the Eastern Conference playoff picture and look likely to reamin the seven seed heading into the postseason. Houston, meanwhile, is fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive. Last year's second seed has sunk to a sub - .500 team this season, and will have a hard - fought battle with Utah and Dallas for the last two spots in the Western Conference playoffs. As always, star guard James Harden stuffed the stat sheet, scoring 34 points, dishing eight assists, and pulling down eight rebounds. However, the All-Star also turned the ball over five times, an issue he has had consistently throughout the season. At 339 turnovers, Harden already has the 13th - most turnovers ever in a single season and is steadily climbing that list. With eight games to go, the Houston star remains on pace to break the notorious mark of 366 set by Artis Gilmore back in 1978. Houston Will Visit Cleveland on Tuesday, while Indiana will host Chicago.
