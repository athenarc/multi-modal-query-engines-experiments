The Atlanta Hawks (40 - 8) survived a scare from the Philadelphia 76ers (10 - 38) Saturday night, eking out a 91 - 85 win Saturday at the Philips Arena. Atlanta saw a 21 - point lead in the second quarter evaporate as Luc Richard Mbah a Moute tied it up at 81 with 3:19 to go in the fourth. Dennis Schroder was huge down the stretch in this game, hitting the go - ahead three with 1:35 remaining. Philadelphia lacked a sense of urgency after a timeout with under a minute to go and was unable to close the gap. Al Horford turned in another strong performance Saturday, recording 23 points and 11 rebounds to help Atlanta extend its winning streak to 19 games. Philadelphia hung tough with the best team in the Eastern conference and nearly ended Atlanta's win streak. Michael Carter-Williams briefly exited the game to get his ankle re - taped, but returned to action. The 76ers will return to action Monday against the Cavaliers in Cleveland. Atlanta came into the game missing its top two small forwards, with DeMarre Carroll and Thabo Sefolosha sidelined with injuries. Kent Bazemore filled in at small forward and contributed three points and three rebounds over 30 minutes. Dennis Schroder added 15 points and six assists in 28 minutes off the bench. The Hawks are off on Sunday before traveling to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans on Monday.
