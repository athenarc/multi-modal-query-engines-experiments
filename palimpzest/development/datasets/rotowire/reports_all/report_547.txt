The Indiana Pacers (21 - 33) cruised to an 106 - 93 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans (27 - 26) on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center. The Pelicans sorely missed Anthony Davis once again as they did n't have a single player score more than 15 points. The Pacers were led by George Hill, who finished with 17 points and nine assists over 29 minutes of action. Indiana scored their seventh win against Western Conference competition Wednesday and enters the All-Star break in decent position in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Pacers have now won four of their last five games. They will return to action Feb. 20 against the 76ers in Philadelphia. New Orleans has been decimated by injuries of late. Anthony Davis missed his second straight game Wednesday, and his absence was apparent. Eric Gordon and Tyreke Evans combined for 5 - for - 20 shooting to finish with just 14 points between them. The Pelicans will return to action Feb. 20 against the Magic.
