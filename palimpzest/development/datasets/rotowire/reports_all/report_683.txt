The Portland Trail Blazers (25 - 7) defeated the New York Knicks (5 - 28) 101 - 79 on Sunday. Portland has won three straight games. Wesley Matthews scored a game - high 28 points to pace the Trail Blazers. Not needed for much in the blowout, Damian Lillard scored 11 points and handed out six assists. LaMarcus Aldridge sat out a second straight game with an illness, but Chris Kaman, whom was away from the team for a personal reason for their last game, was able to return. Kaman put up 13 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench. Third-year center Joel Freeland put up the first double - double of his career, posting 10 points and 10 rebounds in 25 minutes. The Trail Blazers will stay home to host the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday. New York has lost eight straight games. The Trail Blazers held them to 33 percent shooting from the field and 26 percent from beyond the arc. Carmelo Anthony played through his knee soreness, but with the game out of hand at the half, the Knicks opted to start Travis Wear in his place for the start of the third quarter and hold Anthony out. Amar'e Stoudemire (knee), Samuel Dalembert (ankle) and J.R. Smith missed the game with their assorted injuries, but despite all of the negative injuries the Knicks are dealing with, Cole Aldrich has used the opportunity to shine. He put up 12 points and 19 rebounds in 34 minutes Sunday for a double - double, and he has now strung together four consecutive nice performances in a row. While Aldrich's success is likely just the result of a mediocre player getting more minutes on a struggling team, pulling down 19 rebounds is impressive in any context. The Knicks will wrap up their road trip against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.
