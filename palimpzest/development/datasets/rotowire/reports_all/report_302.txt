The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Sacramento Kings 102 - 88 at Golden 1 Center on Monday. The Timberwolves (24 - 36) picked up just their ninth road win of the season with a relatively easy task in handling the depleted Kings (22 - 35) roster. Minnesota took advantage of an explosive second quarter where they scored 40 points and held the Kings to just 19 points, and the halftime lead was not able to be punctured by Sacramento throughout the rest of the contest. Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns overmatched whatever Sacramento tried to send their way, as the duo combined for 56 points. Wiggins finished with 27 points, four rebounds and one assist on 10 - of - 22 shooting, while Towns added 29 points, 17 rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Rebounding was what kept the Kings out of reach as Gorgui Dieng added 10 boards, and the Wolves totaled 52 as a unit, to just the Kings 42 rebounds. All five Kings starters did finish in double figures scoring, with three tying for the team lead of 14 points. Kosta Koufos, Ben McLemore and Willie Cauley-Stein shared 14 points a piece, while Darren Collison and Ty Lawson pitched in 10 points and 11 points respectively. Koufos rounded out his 14 points with 11 rebounds to finish the double - double. Both teams play on Wednesday, as the Kings visit the Brooklyn Nets, while the Timberwolves host the Utah Jazz.
