The Miami Heat (16 - 21) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (25 - 13) 104 - 90 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The Heat had a strong first half in this one, out - scoring the Clippers 62 - 53 to give them a nice lead heading into the third quarter. They got it done on the defensive side of the ball in the second half, allowing them to secure the road win. The Heat out - rebounded the Clippers 46 - 27, which gave them just enough of an advantage to secure the victory. The Heat's duo of Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade were again a big reason for their success. Bosh led all scorers, going 13 - for - 20 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 34 points, while also adding seven rebounds. The 34 points matched a season - high for him, pushing his season average to 22 points per game. Wade on the other hand recorded 17 points (5 - 15 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 7 - 9 FT) and 10 assists. It was only his third double - double so far this year. In another surprise performance, the Heat received a huge contribution from Hassan Whiteside off of the bench. He went 10 - for - 13 from the field for 23 points, while adding 16 rebounds, two steals and two blocked shots in 28 minutes. He's received more playing time lately and has cashed in with four straight double - digit point performances, despite not recording one at any other time in the season. The only other Heat player to reach double figures in points was Luol Deng, who had 10 points (4 - 9 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt). The Clippers were led by Blake Griffin in this game. He went 10 - for - 19 from the floor and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 26 points. He's had a very strong week, averaging 25 points and eight rebounds per game over his last four games. Chris Paul also found a lot of success against the Heat. He nearly posted a double - double, as he finished with 23 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and nine assists. This marked the first time over his last four games failing to surpass the 10 assist mark. J.J. Redick was the other Clipper to reach double figures in points with 14 (6 - 10 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt) of his own. The Clippers bench had a very poor showing, contributing only15 points. They just did n't have the scoring balance to keep it close. The Heat's next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, while the Clippers will travel to Portland to play the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.
