The Orlando Magic (17 - 39) defeated the New York Knicks (10 - 43) 89 - 83 on Wednesday at the Amway Center. Defense prevailed throughout this low scoring affair as Orlando held New York to 34% shooting from the field. On the other end of the floor, Orlando's Nikola Vucevic had another stellar game against New York. Vucevic ended with 28 points and 18 rebounds to notch his 32nd double - double of the season. New York came into this game with a patchwork lineup after Carmelo Anthony was sidelined with lingering knee issues. Tim Hardaway Jr. moved into the starting lineup and contributed 10 points on 2 - of - 9 shooting. Jason Smith exploded for 21 points in the first half, but added just four points the rest of the way. The Knicks will resume play Feb. 20 against the Heat. Orlando was able to go into the All-Star break on a high note and avoided its 13th loss in 14 contests. The Magic got strong performances from some unlikely players after Channing Frye had to leave the game with a dislocated finger. Dewayne Dedmon had six blocks in 21 minutes before fouling out and Willie Green put up 13 points off the bench. Orlando will return to action Feb. 20 against New Orleans.
