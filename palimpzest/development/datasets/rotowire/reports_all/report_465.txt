The Miami Heat defeated the host Toronto Raptors, 102 - 96, in overtime in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals Tuesday at Air Canada Centre. Heat guard Goran Dragic nailed a three - pointer with 41 seconds to give the Heat a 86 - 81 lead, a shot that appeared to be a dagger. But with four seconds remaining and an 89 - 86 lead, the Heat committed a turnover on an inbounds pass. Terrence Ross hit a free throw to close the gap to two, and Hassan Whiteside missed the first on the other end, leaving the Raptors with three seconds to find a three - pointer to tie the game. With no time outs, Toronto guard Kyle Lowry was forced to bring the ball all the way up the court, but he drained a shot from half - court to force overtime. The Raptors were unable to carry that momentum into the extra period, however, as the Heat opened overtime on a 60 run. Toronto was unable to get its offense restarted, as they did n't score in overtime until there was 1:14 remaining. Dragic hit three three - pointers and scored 26 points (10 - 20 FG) to lead all scorers. After scoring 20 points four times in the first round, Dwyane Wade continued his strong play with 24 points (10 - 21 FG) to go with six rebounds, four assists, three steals and two blocks. Josh Richardson came off the bench to chip in 11 points in an efficient 24 minutes (3 - 6 FG, 2 - 2 3PT, 3 - 4 FT). The Heat only took 11 three - pointers, but they made them count, as they knocked down eight (73 percent). Jonas Valanciunus shined for the Raptors, as he scored 24 points (10 - 16 FG) and grabbed 14 rebounds. DeMar DeRozan added 22 points (9 - 22 FG) and Terrence Ross came off the bench to score 19 points (7 - 13 FG) in 27 minutes. The Raptors shot just 5 - 21 (24 percent) from three - point land and managed just four offensive rebounds, and their inability to create offense outside proved to be their downfall in overtime. Game 2 of this series is scheduled for Thursday at 8:0 PM Eastern Time at Air Canada Centre.
