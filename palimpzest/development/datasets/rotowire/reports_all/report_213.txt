The host Golden State Warriors demolished the Sacramento Kings on Friday, 114 - 100. Golden State (58 - 14) is on the verge of its third straight 60 - win season, holding the league's top record with just 10 games remaining. Fans got to enjoy pure star power on Friday, as the Warriors breezed by the Kings on the backs of two of their healthy All-Stars. Reigning MVP Steph Curry was the team leader in scoring, pouring in 27 points, and also contributed six steals on the defensive end. All-Defense forward Draymond Green, meanwhile, had three steals and a block while scoring 23 points. The two more than made up for a cold night from sharpshooter Klay Thompson, who went just 3 - of - 14 from the field. The night was just one of many great ones for the historic Warriors offense, as the team shot almost 50 percent from the field while dishing out a ridiculous 37 assists. Sacramento (27 - 45) is far from the top, as the team dropped its fourth straight game on Friday in miserable fashion. The team showed promise, however, as recently - acquired rookie Buddy Hield had arguably his best game as a pro. Hield scored a team - high 22 points to go along with eight rebounds and seven assists. It was also a big night for the Kings' other rookie sensation, Skal Labissiere. Just a week after becoming the first member of the 2016 draft class to score 30 points, Labissiere narrowly missed his first career triple - double, coming away with 10 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists. Golden State will host the Grizzlies on Sunday, while the Kings will visit the LA Clippers.
