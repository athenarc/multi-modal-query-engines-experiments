The Pistons pulled off the road upset in the season opener against the Hawks on Tuesday night, upending Atlanta by a score of 106 - 94. The two teams’ performance from the three - point line was the determining factor in this one, as the visiting Pistons knocked down 12 - of - 29 shots (41 percent) from deep. The Hawks, meanwhile were an ugly 8 - for - 27 (30 percent) from beyond the arc. Detroit rode a balanced scoring attack to the victory column, as all five starters finished with at least 15 points. Leading the way was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who shook off a recent foot injury to pour in 21 points on 7 - for - 14 shooting, including a 4 - for - 7 mark from three - point range. The Pistons also received strong production on the interior from Andre Drummond, who tallied 18 points and 19 rebounds. The double - doubles should roll in with regularity this season for Drummond, who recorded 48 such efforts in 2014 - 15. Meanwhile, the Hawks hardly resembled a squad that won a franchise - best 60 games a season ago. In addition to getting very little scoring from their starting backcourt - - the trio of Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, and Kent Bazemore finished with just 25 points between them - - the Hawks were also bullied on the interior by Drummond & Co. Al Horford pulled down just four rebounds on the evening, and the Pistons held a 59 - 40 edge on the glass over the night. It didn’t help matters that the Hawks lost backup big man Mike Muscala to a right ankle sprain over the course of the game. The Hawks will look to regroup when they visit the Knicks on Friday, while Detroit will have a quick turnaround and play the second game of a back - to - back set at home Thursday against the Jazz.
