The point guards for both the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder rounded out the box score to astronomical numbers across the four periods and overtime. Russell Westbrook headlined the game, once again, adding another triple - double to his already impressive 2016 - 2017 campaign. Westbrook finished with 31 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds on 13 - of - 34 shooting in 40 minutes of action. Jeff Teague was lackluster on the defensive end of the floor, but made up for it with a tremendous effort down the stretch and especially from the free throw line. Teague scored 30 points, to go along with nine assists and five rebounds on 9 - of - 16 shooting, including a perfect 9 - of - 9 from the charity stripe. Westbrook's needed the overtime to complete the triple - double, but was also the reason that Oklahoma City was able to reach the extended period after burying a three pointer from 27 - feet with only a few seconds left in the fourth quarter.
