The Sacramento Kings (28 - 53) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (21 - 60) 102 - 92 on Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento. With both teams already eliminated from the playoffs, this game was more about getting a look at players in anticipation of next season. It also cemented the Lakers with the fourth worst record in the league, meaning they'll have the fourth best odds to win the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. The Kings won this game in the fourth quarter, where they went on a huge run to out - score the Lakers 27 - 18. The Kings also secured the shooting advantage, finishing at 49 percent from the field, while the Lakers ended at 42 percent. With DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay being shut down for the rest of the season, Omri Casspi continued to take over as the leader of this team. He went off for a game - high of 26 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 10 - 13 FT), while nearly notching a triple - double with nine rebounds and six assists as well. Over his last five games, he's averaging an impressive 22 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists. Coming off the bench, Derrick Williams had a strong showing as well. He went 6 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 20 points over 29 minutes. Like Casspi, he's been relied upon to pick up the slack without Cousins and Gay, as he's averaged 16 points over his last five games. Jason Thompson came up with a 10 - point (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 4 FT), 10 - rebound double - double, while also recording three blocked shots. It marked the third time over his last four games reaching double - digit rebounds. Both Carl Landry and Ray McCallum reached double figures as well. Landry had 14 points (5 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds over 19 minutes, while McCallum added 12 points (5 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and five rebounds over 28 minutes. Rookie Jordan Clarkson was again one of the few Lakers to have some success. He went 10 - for - 21 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 23 points, to go along with five rebounds, six assists and five steals. Clarkson has already earned himself a role for this team next year, but he continues to improve his numbers late in the season, averaging 22 points and 7 assists over his last five games. Jabari Brown also played well in the loss, finishing with 18 points (6 - 17 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT) and seven assists over 46 minutes. It marked his third straight game with 18 points or more, as he's pushed his season averages to 11 points and 2 assists over 18 games with the Lakers. The only other Laker in double figures was Jordan Hill. Hill posted 18 points (9 - 19 FG) of his own, while adding six rebounds and four assists. The Lakers had only seven players available for this game, as they are dealing with a ton of injuries. These two teams will play each other again on Wednesday in each team's final game of the season.
