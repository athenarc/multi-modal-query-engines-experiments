The Phoenix Suns (8 - 5) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0 - 12) 122 - 96 on Friday. Phoenix is in the midst of a six - game road trip. After dropping the first game of the trip 120 - 107 to the Los Angeles Clippers, they've rattled off three consecutive wins over some of the never - weres of the Eastern Conference. Isaiah Thomas paced the Suns on Friday. He put up 23 points and eight rebounds in 24 minutes off the bench. They'll continue their trip Saturday in Indiana against the Pacers. Philadelphia has lost 12 straight games to start the season. While that's a deplorable situation to be in regardless of the situation, it's in no way a surprise that the Sixers have n't been able to pull off a win. Tony Wroten started at shooting guard next to Michael Carter-Williams on Friday, an experiment the Sixers seemed to be opposed to coming into this season, and it's a starting lineup that is unlikely to stick. K.J. McDaniels scored a career - high 17 points in 28 minutes, and the fact that he played so many minutes after commenting to the media that he is frustrated with his playing time indicates that the team did n't take much offense to his comments. The Sixers will have a legitmitate chance at their first win of the season Saturday when they go to New York to face the Knicks.
