The Phoenix Suns (20) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (1 - 1) 94 - 89 on Friday. Kawhi Leonard returned to the active lineup for the Spurs after missing extended time with an eye infection. He started at small forward and played 24 minutes. With Tiago Splitter (back/calf) still sidelined, Austin Daye was given a spot start at power forward to matchup with the Suns' small - ball power forward Markieff Morris. Daye played 19 minutes and finished with six points. Matt Bonner, who started the Spurs' opener at center did not get off the bench against the Suns. Alex Len played a career - high 32 minutes and finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds to record the first double - double of his NBA career. Len did his damage off the bench, while starting center Miles Plumlee played just 15 minutes, a development that does n't mean much in the course of one game, but after the Suns invested a fifth - overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft on Len, his development is something they're going to be keen to push, and that may come at the expense of Plumlee at some point. Isaiah Thomas lead the Suns with a team - high 23 points off the bench. The Spurs have four days off before their next game at home Wednesday against the Atlanta Hawks. The Suns will finish a back - to - back set on the road Saturday against the Utah Jazz.
