The Sacramento Kings (11 - 10) defeated the Utah Jazz (5 - 16) 101 - 92 on Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento. Despite only having five victories on the year, the Jazz put up a fight and kept even with the Kings all the way up until the start of the fourth quarter. The Kings were able to use a significant rebounding advantage and superior shooting to out - score the Jazz 33 - 24 in the final quarter, thus sealing the nine - point victory at home. With DeMarcus Cousins still sitting out with an illness, Rudy Gay continued to take the lead for the Kings. He shot 10 - for - 19 from the field and 0 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 29 points. He also got to the free throw line 10 times, and was able to convert on nine of those attempts, pushing his season scoring average to 21 points per game. Darren Collison was an important piece in the victory. He scored 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and handed out six assists in 32 minutes, as he also was continued to be relied upon to make up for the loss of Cousins. Nik Stauskas had arguably his best game of the season, as he recorded a season - high of 15 points (6 - 12 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench. The Jazz failed to receive very much production from their bench, therefore putting it on the shoulders of their starters. Gordon Hayward led the team with 19 points (6 - 16 FG, 1 - 7 3Pt, 6 - 10 FT) and seven assists, while also matching a season - high with four steals. He struggled against the Magic on Friday, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Alec Burks chipped in 16 points (5 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 6 - 9 FT) of his own, as he's put together a couple of solid games in a row. He's combined for 38 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in the previous two games, giving the Jazz a little bit of everything. Both Enes Kanter and Trey Burke finished with 13 points, but it was n't enough to propel the Jazz past the Kings. The Kings' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, while the Jazz will play the San Antonio Spurs at home on Tuesday as well.
