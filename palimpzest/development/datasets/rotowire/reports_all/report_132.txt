The San Antonio Spurs (35 - 23) defeated the Sacramento Kings (20 - 36) 107 - 96 on Friday. The Spurs have been struggling as of late, losing their four games previous to Friday's win over the Kings, who were without DeMarcus Cousins due to hip and ankle injuries. Kawhi Leonard played a team - high 36 minutes and finished with 17 points, seven rebounds, five assists, two blocks and one steal to lead his team to victory. Tiago Splitter had nine rebounds and three blocks. He was given the start at center, which moved Aron Baynes to the bench. Baynes played 18 minutes and scored eight points. Jason Thompson shifted over to the center position to make room for Carl Landry who got the start in place of Cousins. Landry and Thompson combined for 20 points and 16 rebounds. Second-year player Ben McLemore led Sacramento in points with 21. He hit 10 of his 12 free throw attempts. The Kings are now 13 - 17 at home this season. San Antonio will travel to Phoenix to take on the Suns on Saturday, and the Kings will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday.
