The Indiana Pacers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 103 - 93, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday. The Cavaliers (9 - 2), coming off a hard - fought shootout with the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday, announced earlier in the day that both LeBron James and J.R. Smith would both miss the game for rest. That propelled Richard Jefferson and Iman Shumpert into the starting five, and put an even bigger - than - usual spotlight on Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The latter duo did combine for 51 points, but conversely, the pair of spot starters could only muster nine points overall. That left a certain scoring vacuum that Cleveland simply could n't overcome, leading to only the second loss of the season for the defending champs. Love led all scorers with 27 points, 16 rebounds and an assist. Irving was next with 24 points, seven assists, two rebounds and a steal. With such a large share of the offensive responsibility, both players combined to put up 43 shot attempts. Tristan Thompson could n't help on the scoreboard either, posting just two points, but he did haul in 12 rebounds, dished out three assists and recorded a block. Rookie Kay Felder and Jordan McRae paced the reserves with a pair of nine - point efforts, with the point total representing a career high for the former. The Pacers (6 - 6) saw four - fifths of their first unit manage double - digit scoring and were led by Paul George, who supplied 21 points, 11 rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. Jeff Teague registered 20 points, eight assists, four rebounds, a steal and a block. Thaddeus Young totaled 16 points, seven boards, an assist and a steal, while Myles Turner tallied 12 points, eight rebounds, four blocks and a steal. C.J. Miles paced the reserves with 10 points and a steal. The Cavaliers head back home for a Friday night date with the Detroit Pistons, while the Pacers remain home and await the Phoenix Suns for a Friday evening tussle.
