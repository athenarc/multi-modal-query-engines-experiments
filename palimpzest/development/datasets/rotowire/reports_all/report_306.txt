The Orlando Magic (5 - 7) took down the Detroit Pistons (3 - 8) 107 - 93 on the road at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday night. The Magic may finally have found their groove. Winners of three of their last four games, Orlando is looking like a team that you do n't want to play right now. On Monday night, the team was led by an impressive all - around performance from their starting lineup. Each of the five starters managed to put up double - digit points, with Nikola Vucevic posting an impressive double - double that included 25 points (10 - 18 FG, 5 - 5 FT), with 14 rebounds and three assists. Tobias Harris also had another strong night, scoring 24 points (10 - 17 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), and contributing five rebounds, five steals, four assists and one block. Orlando heads back home next, and will be tested against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night. The Pistons on the other hand have lost two straight, and five of their last six games. This team ca n't get the ball rolling in the right direction currently, regardless of who steps up. On Monday, it was Caron Butler who stepped up off the bench for Detroit, scoring 20 points (5 - 11 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 7 FT), with six rebounds and one assist. The Pistons also got a double - double from big man Andre Drummond, who scored 12 points (5 - 12 FG, 2 - 4 FT), to go along with 10 rebounds and three blocks. Detroit will remain at home as they take on the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night.
