It was a tough night for Denver's young core on Sunday, particularly in terms of shooting. Sophomore point guard Emmanuel Mudiay shot just 3 - of - 16 from the field, while second - year big men Nikola Jokic and Jusuf Nurkic combined to go just 3 - of - 14. Rookie Jamal Murray shot a promising 6 - of - 12, but committed a team - high six turnovers. Veterans stepped up, however, as Danilo Gallinari scored a team - high 19 points on 7 - of - 13 shooting. Forward Kenneth Faried had a particularly big night, scoring 18 points and pulling down 14 rebounds to go along with four blocks. For Portland, meanwhile, it was the same story as usual. Point guard Damian Lillard led the team with 32 points, and C.J. McCollum finished behind him with 21. Lillard also contributed eight rebounds and six assists. Forward Mo Harkless delivered a promising 17 points and six assists in his new starting role.
