In fact, Dallas had their bench score 44 points, while Orlando's bench combined for 45 points of their own. The two leading scorers came off the bench too, as Jonathan Gibson dropped 26 points in his second game with the Mavs and D.J. Augustin scored 18 for the Magic. The backcourt of Wesley Matthews and Seth Curry scored 13 apiece, but they combined to go 8 - of - 23 from the field. Orlando's stars were n't any better, as Nikola Vucevic and Evan Fournier combined to go 8 - of - 29 from the field. Amazingly, Dallas was 13 - of - 28 from three - point range, which was half of their makes for the evening (26 - of - 77). Rebounding was the big difference in the game, with Orlando snatching down 50 boards to Dallas' 34.
