The Oklahoma City Thunder (14 - 8) took down the Atlanta Hawks (14 - 10) by a 107 - 94 final score Thursday night at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. The Thunder rode a 35 - point first quarter to an early lead and never trailed in the final three quarters as the home squad shot the lights out. Oklahoma City shot a pristine 49 percent from the floor and 53 percent (9 - 17) from three - point land, an efficient attack that was too much for the Hawks to handle. The Hawks hit 10 threes of their own, but were manhandled on the boards, as the Thunder won the rebounding battle 52 - 34. Kevin Durant notched a triple - double for the Thunder as he dropped 25 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists on Atlanta. Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka scored 23 points each and both tallied double - doubles, as Westbrook distributed 10 assists and Ibaka pulled down 10 rebounds. Kent Bazemore did what he could off the bench to keep the Hawks in it, as he knocked down 22 points on a smooth 7 - 12 shooting night, including four three - pointers. Jeff Teague led Hawks starters with 18 points, while Al Horford suffered a terrible 3 - 14 shooting night and managed just nine points and seven rebounds. Paul Millsap also could n't get it going, as he managed only seven points on five field goal attempts over 33 minutes of action. The Hawks will face the Spurs on Saturday back in Atlanta in a marquee inter - conference matchup. The Thunder will go on the road to Utah for a Friday night game as they try to extend their winning streak to four.
