The Raptors did n't need much beyond DeMar DeRozan and Jonas Valanciunas on Wednesday to beat the Pistons. The duo combined for 72 points on 27 - for - 42 shooting, while the rest of the starting five could only muster a 30 percent success rate (7 - for - 23) from the field. Pascal Siakam, Toronto's 2016 first - round pick, pitched in nine boards while starting at power forward, but Kyle Lowry was the only other player to manage double - digit scoring (10 points). Andre Drummond was often overmatched by Valanciunas and collected a modest 16 points and six boards. The Pistons had a similarly unbalanced box score, as Drummond, Marcus Morris and Tobias Harris combined for 55 of the team's 91 points while shooting 22 - for - 41 from the field. Meanwhile, their starting backcourt of Ish Smith and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope went cold, supplying a combined 10 points on 5 - for - 19 shooting.
