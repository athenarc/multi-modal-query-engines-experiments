Atlanta is not accustomed to being held to 68 points on 31 percent shooting, but they have n't seen a defense like the one Utah possesses. The Jazz actually ranked first in the NBA with under 95 points a game allowed and that number surely dropped here. Dennis Schroeder was the only starter to play well for the Hawks, as he scored 16 points on an inefficient 6 - of - 19 shooting. Gordon Hayward was the player of the game for Utah, as he dropped 24 points and seven rebounds. George Hill was n't far behind, finishing with 23 points and five rebounds. Double-doubles by Rudy Gobert and Trey Lyles were huge as well. The Jazz defense was on display in this win, as they won the rebounding battle, 55 - 40, and held the Atlanta starters to 37 points on under 27 percent shooting. The Jazz held the lead for the final 30 - plus minutes, as they led by 32 at times in their dominating victory.
