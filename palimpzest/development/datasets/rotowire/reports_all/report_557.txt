The Houston Rockets (1 - 1) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (1 - 1) 115 - 109 on Wednesday at the Toyota Center in Houston. After coming out of the first quarter down by 11, the Clippers took off in the second behind Blake Griffin, out - scoring the Rockets 41 - 21 to take a nine - point lead into the half. While it looked as if the Clippers had all the momentum, it was instead all Rockets in the second half, as they finally got into a rhythm and took advantage of a Clippers' team who was without Chris Paul. The Clippers shot 45 percent from the field and 24 percent from the three - point line, while the Rockets finished at 43 percent from the field and just 19 percent from deep. James Harden was a big reason the Rockets finally turned things around in the second half. He finished with 32 points (7 - 17 FG, 3 - 10 3Pt), 16 of which came in the fourth quarter, while also adding three rebounds and seven assists. He did have seven turnovers though, so it was n't all good for the guard. While he hit only 30 percent of his three - point shots, Harden did what he does best and got to the free throw line. He went a perfect 15 - of - 15 from the line, helping the Rockets shoot a whopping 64 free throws. Harden did receive a ton of help from Dwight Howard though. Howard went just 8 - for - 21 from the free throw line, but he still managed to score 24 points (8 - 11 FG) in 35 minutes. Howard recorded 16 rebounds and four blocked shots as well, helping the Rockets to secure a 54 - 40 rebounding advantage, which also made a big difference. Trevor Ariza chipped in with a 15 - point (4 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 6 - 7 FT), 13 - rebound double - double as well. Right from the start, Blake Griffin knew he'd have to do the bulk of the work for this team with Chris Paul still sidelined. Griffin recorded 14 points in the first quarter alone, and then went on to score a game - high of 34 points (13 - 23 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 8 - 11 FT), while also adding 15 rebounds and four assists. He was making jump shots, getting in the post, basically doing everything he wanted all night, but the Clippers just did n't play enough defense in the second half to come out successful. Griffin is averaging an impressive 25 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists over the first nine games of the playoffs, but he'll welcome the return of Chris Paul with open arms for game three. DeAndre Jordan notched a double - double of his own, recording 16 points (6 - 6 FG, 4 - 6 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. He's now posted double - digit rebounds in eight of nine playoff games. Jamal Crawford added 19 points off the bench, but he shot just 6 - for - 22 from the field and 1 - for - 8 from the three - point line, as he seemed to struggle with his shot. These teams will now head to Los Angeles for game three on Friday.
