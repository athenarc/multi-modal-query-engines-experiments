The Golden State Warriors (3 - 2) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (2 - 3) 98 - 78 on Wednesday at Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Grizzlies got off to a quick start in the first quarter, at one point leading by double - digits. The Warriors came back late in the first though and ended with a one - point lead going into the second quarter. The Warriors then out - scored the Grizzlies 23 - 16 in the second quarter and never let off the gas pedal to finish with a 20 - point win in front of their home crowd. The Warriors finished the game shooting 47 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line, while the Grizzlies finished at 40 percent from the floor and just 27 percent from deep. The Warriors now have a 3 - 2 lead in the series and a ton of momentum following this dominating performance. With Grizzlies' defensive specialist Tony Allen sidelined with a hamstring injury, Klay Thompson was able to take advantage of a lesser defeneder and lead the Warriors to the victory. He went 7 - for - 16 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 21 points, while also adding four rebounds and five assists. Thompson is dialed in from deep right now, combining to go 9 - for - 16 from the three - point line over his last three games. Fellow superstar and MVP Stephen Curry also played a huge factor in this game. Curry finished with 18 points (6 - 16 FG, 6 - 13 3Pt), seven rebounds, five assists and six steals over 33 minutes. Curry hit five three - pointers for 15 points in the first half alone, but did n't have to do much in the second half considering the Warriors' extensive lead. Defensively, the six steals marked a career playoff - high for Curry as well. Both Harrison Barnes and Andre Iguodala were also very effective though. Barnes finished with 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 5 FT) and three rebounds over 33 minutes, while Iguodala added an efficient 16 points (7 - 10 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt) and three assists over 25 minutes off the bench. The Grizzlies, on the other hand, were led by Marc Gasol. Gasol recorded 18 points (8 - 22 FG, 2 - 2 FT), 12 rebounds and six assists, but he did n't receive enough help from the rest of his team. The double - double was his third straight, increasing his series averages to 19 points and 10 rebounds per game. Zach Randolph looked like he was going to have a solid showing after 11 points in the first quarter alone. It turned out to be the exact opposite though, as he hit just one shot the rest of the game and finished with 13 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt), to go along with 10 rebounds over 34 minutes. Randolph had put up at least 15 shot attempts in seven of the first eight games of the postseason, but he's now gone two straight outings with 12 attempts or less. Mike Conley posted 13 points (5 - 10 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) and five assists, while Jeff Green recorded 10 points (5 - 13 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt) and four rebounds. The Grizzlies really missed Tony Allen's defense, as they did n't have an answer for the Warriors' hot shooting. Game six will take place on Friday in Memphis.
