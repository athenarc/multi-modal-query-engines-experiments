The Boston Celtics (11 - 8) defeated the Sacramento Kings (7 - 13) 114 - 97 on Thursday in Mexico City. Boston outscored Sacramento 32 - 17 in the first quarter and the game was never competitive after that. The frustration clearly boiled over for this Kings team, as Rajon Rondo was ejected in the third quarter. The Celtics came into this game as one of the best assisting teams in the NBA and that proved to be the difference, as they outassisted the Kings 34 - 21. Boston also shot 48 percent from the field, while Sacramento shot just 38 percent. Boston came into this game as the more well - rounded team with less talent and the teamwork prevailed yet again. While DeMarcus Cousins, Rajon Rondo and Rudy Gay were likely the three best players on the floor, the Celtics are simply a better team. In fact, four players on the Celtics scored at least 20 points and this was an all - around great team effort. It was a revenge game for Isaiah Thomas and he was fantastic, tallying 21 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four steals in the win. Kelly Olynyk also had a nice game off the bench, as he collected 21 points, four rebounds and four assists in the victory. Boston will have a great test in their next game when they take on the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday. The Kings had a rough night in Mexico City and they'll be happy to get out of there. Rondo was ejected in the third quarter for two technical fouls and it was a bit of a surprise he was the only one with all the frustration the Kings showed. DeMarcus Cousins had a lackluster game, as he tallied just 16 points, seven rebounds and four assists while battling foul trouble. The best player for Sacramento on this night was Rudy Gay, who contributed 18 points and seven rebounds in the loss. The Kings will look to bounce - back when they take on the Houston Rockets on Saturday in what should be a high - scoring bonanza.
