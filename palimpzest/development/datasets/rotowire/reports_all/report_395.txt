John Wall had a double - double, Kris Humphries added 11 points and the Wizards (15 - 6) got a last - second layup from Bradley Beal to knock off the Magic (9 - 15) 91 - 89 on Wednesday. Washington, winners of six of its last seven games, trailed by eight entering the fourth quarter but was able to hold the Celtics to just 14 points in the final 12 minutes. The Wizards slowly chipped away at the Boston lead, and a John Wall-led run late in the period brought the Wizards to within one with 32 seconds to play. A Rasual Butler free throw with 16 seconds to play tied the game, and Victor Oladipo misfired on a long jumper on the other end, giving the Wizards a chance to win with 1 seconds remaining. That’s all Beal would need, as he caught a perfect inbound lob from Andre Miller and laid it in as time expired. Beal had just eight points on the night, going a quiet 4 - of - 8 from the field in 34 minutes. Wall finished with 21 points and 11 assists and Marcin Gortat added 10 points and five rebounds. Paul Piece added eight points, six boards and five assists. In his return from a five - game absence, Nene chipped in 12 points and six rebounds off the bench. Orlando was led by 17 points (7 - 16 FG) and six rebounds from Oladipo. Tobias Harris had 15 points and six rebounds, and Kyle O’Quinn and Channing Frye each added 10 points. Rookie Elfrid Payton contributed 12 points and six rebounds in 29 minutes off the bench. Up next, Orlando begins a home - in - home with the Hawks in Atlanta on Friday. The Wizards return home to face the Clippers, also on Friday.
