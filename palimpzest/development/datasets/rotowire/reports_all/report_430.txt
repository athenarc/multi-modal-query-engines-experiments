The Dallas Mavericks (12 - 5) defeated the Toronto Raptors (13 - 3) 106 - 102 on Friday. Dallas has won two straight and eight of their last ten games. Monta Ellis scored a game - high 30 points in 36 minutes. Jameer Nelson (back) was held out. Devin Harris started at point guard in his place and finished with eight points and six assists in 33 minutes. Six players scored in double digits for the Mavs, including 14 points from Al-Farouq Aminu off the bench. They continue their road trip with a lighter meal against the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. Toronto had their six - game win streak snapped with this loss, but more devestating was that DeMar DeRozan had to leave the game with a left groin strain after 20 minutes of action, and his status going forward is unclear. Louis Williams and Greivis Vasquez picked up the backcourt slack with DeRozan out. Williams scored 16 points in 30 minutes off the bench, while Vasquez put up 14 points and six assists in 25 minutes off the bench. The Raptors will embark on a three - game road trip that begins in Los Angeles on Sunday against the Lakers.
