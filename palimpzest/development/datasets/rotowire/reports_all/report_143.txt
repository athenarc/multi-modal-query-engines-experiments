The Portland Trail Blazers (6 - 3) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (4 - 4) 97 - 87 on Saturday. Portland has won four straight games, and they earned their latest win with LaMarcus Aldridge (illness) and Nicolas Batum (knee) out of the lineup. Allen Crabbe has been filling in as the starting small forward while Batum has been out the last three games, and coach Terry Stotts threw a minor curve ball Saturday by inserting Meyers Leonard into the starting lineup in place of Aldridge. Leonard pulled down 12 rebounds and showed off his new three - point shot, converting 1 - of - 3 attempts. The Trail Blazers have two more games on their homestand, with the next coming against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday. Brooklyn dropped all three games on their short Western Conference roadtrip, and they'll head home to host the Miami Heat on Monday. Portland's three - point shooting was too much for Brooklyn on Saturday, and the Nets struggled on offense, shooting just 39 percent from the field and five percent from beyond the arc. Kevin Garnett recorded a double - double of 12 points and 12 rebounds in 27 minutes.
