The Oklahoma City Thunder (50 - 22) defeated the Utah Jazz (35 - 37) 113 - 91 on Thursday. This marks Oklahoma City's sixth straight win and it made Utah tied for the final playoff spot in the West. The game was well out of hand headed to the fourth quarter, as the Thunder had a 21 - point lead. The key for Oklahoma City was the ball movement, as they recorded 27 assists to the Jazz '18. Utah really struggled with their shooting, as they went 23 percent from three - point range and 70 percent from the free - throw line. Utah was a double - digit underdog headed into this game and they really didn’t put up much of a fight. No player on Utah scored more than 17 points and the five starters combined for just 34 points. Trey Burke led the team with 17 points off the bench, despite playing just 12 minutes. Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors combined for just 13 points and four rebounds, which is simply too difficult to overcome. On deck for Utah is a matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday. With Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook both approaching triple - doubles, there wasn’t much doubt they'd lose this game. Durant finished with 20 points, eight rebounds and nine assists, with Westbrook tallying 15 points, seven rebounds and nine assists of his own. Dion Waiters played well off the bench, as he amassed 17 points, three assists and three steals. The Thunder will look to extend their winning streak to seven games against San Antonio Spurs on Saturday.
