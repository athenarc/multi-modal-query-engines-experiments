The Houston Rockets defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 129 - 99 Thursday at Smoothie King Center. The Rockets (41 - 18) wasted no time spoiling the homecoming of the new - look Pelicans (23 - 35), as New Orleans only managed to stick around for one quarter, as Houston managed to open up 16 - point lead heading into halftime and never looked back. Leading the way for the Rockets was a player who has only been on the team for a couple of days. In his first game as a Rocket, Lou Williams posted a team - high 27 points in just 25 minutes off the bench. Williams' only competition for Sixth Man of the Year this season, Eric Gordon, was n't too far behind, scoring 19 points in 30 minutes as a reserve Thursday. Those two led the way for a now - revamped bench unit that carried Houston all game long, as seven bench players combined to score 79 points and made up for an underwhelming performance from James Harden, who had just 13 points in 30 minutes. As for the Pelicans, the daunting frontcourt of Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins did their job, but the rest of the team struggled. Davis led the way with a team - high 29 points and nine rebounds, while Cousins posted his first double - double as a Pelican, recording 27 points, 14 rebounds, fives assists, five steals and four blocks in 35 minutes. The only other New Orleans player who managed to score in double figures was Omri Casspi, who was playing his first career game in a Pelicans uniform and finished with 12 points. In the end, it was New Orleans' horrid outing from behind the arc that prevented the Pelicans from making this game close, as they shot just 6 - of - 31 from long range Thursday night. Up next, the Rockets will head home Saturday to take on the Timberwolves, while the Pelicans will look to turn things around Saturday in Dallas.
