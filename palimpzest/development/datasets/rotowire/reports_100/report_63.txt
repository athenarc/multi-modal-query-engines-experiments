The Chicago Bulls (32 - 20) defeated the Orlando Magic (16 - 38) 98 - 97 on Sunday at the Amway Center in Orlando. Down 97 - 96 with just under 10 seconds left in the game, Pau Gasol was able to to throw down a dunk to put the Bulls up one. The Magic went to Nikola Vucevic for the game winner, but he was n't able to convert, giving the Bulls the narrow victory on the road in Orlando. While the Magic were able to out - rebound the Bulls 45 - 35, they were forced into 18 turnovers, which may have been just enough to push the Bulls to win number 32 on the season and keep them a half game ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division. The Bulls saw huge games from both Jimmy Butler and Gasol. Butler was all over the place, recording a team - high of 27 points (9 - 16 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT), to go along with five assists and an impressive six steals. He's played extremely well of late, averaging 24 points, 4 steals and 4 assists over his last three games. The six steals also matched a season - high. Gasol, on the other hand, posted 25 points (10 - 16 FG, 5 - 6 FT) and 15 rebounds in 37 minutes. It was his twelfth double - double in a row, pushing his season averages to 18 points and 12 rebounds per game. While slightly over - shadowed by the performances of Butler and Gasol, Joakim Noah had a large impact on this game. He finished with 18 points (7 - 10 FG, 4 - 4 FT), nine rebounds and two steals. It matched a season - high in points for him as well and was great for his confidence offensively, as he had combinded for only three points over his last two games. Derrick Rose notched a double - double with 10 points (4 - 14 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and 11 assists. The Magic saw six players reach double figures in points, including all five of their starters, but still were n't able to hold off the Bulls. Victor Oladipo finished with a team - high of 18 points (8 - 16 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), while also adding six assists and two steals. He continues to make a nice contribution defensively, as it was his third straight game recording two steals. He's now averaging 17 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists on the year. Tobias Harris nearly recorded a double - double, posting 15 points (6 - 17 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), eight rebounds and three steals. He's had a nice three - game stretch where he's averaged 24 points and 8 rebounds per game. The ever so consistent Nikola Vucevic had somewhat of a down game, totaling 14 points (5 - 14 FG, 4 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds in 32 minutes. It was his lowest scoring output since January ninth against the Lakers, so it came quite unexpected. Coming off the bench, Evan Fournier was very efficient with his time and posted 14 points (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), three rebounds and three assists in only 18 minutes. The Magic's next game will be on the road against the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Bulls will be at home against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday.
