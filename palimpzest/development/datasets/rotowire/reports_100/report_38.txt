The Phoenix Suns (34 - 32) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14 - 49) 106 - 97 on Wednesday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix. The Suns got out to a quick start in this one, grabbing a 25 - 18 lead right away after the first quarter. It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game, but the Suns were able to pull off a huge win, as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Suns were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 44 percent from the floor and a disgraceful eight percent from beyond the arc. The Suns were led by Markieff Morris, who finished with a team - high of 24 points (10 - 15 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), to go along with three rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. It was a very nice bounce - back outing for the forward, as he posted just four points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field during Monday's game against the Warriors. He's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year. Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe, who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and nine assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games. The Suns gained even more of an advantage from their bench in the win, as they were extremely productive. Rookie T.J. Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points (8 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) in just 19 minutes. The Suns drafted him knowing he could score at a high rate, so it's not surprising he was finally able to show a little more of what he's got. Marcus Thornton also reached double figures off the bench, with 14 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and four rebounds in 22 minutes. Kevin Martin did his best to keep the Timberwolves in this game. He went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 6 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 16 points. After shooting just 25 percent (2 - 8 FG) from the field in Monday's game against the Clippers, it was good to see him hit on such a high percentage of shots Wednesday. In a solid performance off the bench, Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points, while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves, as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season. With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season. In 29 minutes, he finished with 10 points (3 - 9 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds. Andrew Wiggins did n't have much of an impact either, as he also had just 10 points (5 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt) and four rebounds. The Suns' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Friday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Friday.
