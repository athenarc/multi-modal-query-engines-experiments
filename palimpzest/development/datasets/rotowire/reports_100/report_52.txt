The Atlanta Hawks (6 - 5) defeated the Detroit Pistons (3 - 10) 99 - 89 on Friday. Atlanta was coming off two straight losses but were able to beat the Pistons in relatively convincing fashion. Jeff Teague had his way in the paint and finished with 26 points and six assists in 33 minutes. DeMarre Carroll (groin) returned to action and was put right back into the starting lineup. He finished with nine points and five rebounds in 30 minutes. The Hawks have three days off before they go on the road to Washington to face the Wizards on Tuesday. Detroit continues to use their big lineup that features Josh Smith at small forward despite the fact that they've been unable to win games with it. The Pistons have lost four straight games. In Friday's loss, they shot 38 percent from the field and 19 percent from beyond the arc, two numbers that are hard to overcome and earn a win with. They have three days off before traveling to Milwaukee on Tuesday to face the Bucks.
