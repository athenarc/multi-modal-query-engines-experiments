The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Miami Heat, 98 - 86, at Staples Center on Sunday. A Clippers blowout appeared to be the likely result with the recent form of these teams and that was just the case in this easy 12 - point win. Miami was able to grab two early leads, but the Clippers held a double - digit lead for the final 30 minutes to keep things at ease. The second quarter was the difference in the game, with Los Angeles winning that quarter, 32 - 20.

The Clippers, on the other hand, committed just 11 turnovers and recorded 27 assists to the Heat's 14. The Heat (11 - 28) have now lost 13 of their last 15 games.

Goran Dragic led the team with 24 points, five rebounds and five assists, despite committing five turnovers. Tyler and James Johnson each scored in double figures off the bench, combining for 24 points, 13 rebounds and four assists. Unfortunately for Miami, they play the Golden State Warriors on the road for their next game Friday.
