The Atlanta Hawks (46 - 12) beat the Orlando Magic (19 - 41) 95 - 88 on Friday. Al Horford had a good all - around game, putting up 17 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and two steals in a tough matchup against Nikola Vucevic. Kyle Korver was the lone Atlanta starter not to reach double figures in points. Jeff Teague bounced back from an illness, he scored 17 points to go along with seven assists and two steals. After a rough start to the month, the Hawks have won three straight and sit atop the Eastern Conference with a nine game lead on the second place Toronto Raptors. The Magic lost in devastating fashion to the Miami Heat in overtime Wednesday. They blew a seven point lead with 43 seconds remaining and they might have carried that with them into Friday's contest against the Hawks. Vucevic led the Magic with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Aaron Gordon (ankle) and Evan Fournier (hip) were unable to play due to injury. The Magic have four teams between them and the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Magic will host the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday, and the Hawks with take on the Heat in Miami on Saturday.
