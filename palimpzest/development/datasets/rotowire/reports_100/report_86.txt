The Orlando Magic (28 - 36) defeated the Sacramento Kings (25 - 39) 107 - 100 on Friday. There was some serious star power missing in this game, but the Magic prevailed in an impressive performance. The differential in shooting was key, as Orlando shot 52 percent from the field with the Kings shooting just under 40 percent on their end. The rebounding was a huge factor as well, as the Magic recorded 51 rebounds to the Kings 37. Orlando had to play this game without Nikola Vucevic and Elfrid Payton, but still pulled out a rare road win. Aaron Gordon was the star, as he double - doubled in a 20 - point 11 - rebound performance. While Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier shot poorly, they still combined for 34 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and six steals in the win. The Magic have a quick turnaround, as they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday in their next game. This gives the Kings their eighth loss in their last nine games and they had to play this one without a suspended DeMarcus Cousins. Rajon Rondo ran the team, as he tallied 16 points, 14 assists and five rebounds in the loss. Rudy Gay and Darren Collison really struggled, as they combined to shoot 5 - for - 23 in the defeat. The only other notable line was that of Kosta Koufos, who scored a team - high 19 points off the bench. Cousins should be back for Sacramento's next game, as they play the Utah Jazz on Sunday.
