The Los Angeles Clippers (46 - 27) defeated the Boston Celtics (43 - 31) 114 - 90 at Staples Center on Monday. Both the Clippers and Celtics control the 4 - seed in their respective conferences, but Los Angeles proved once again that the elite teams in the Western Conference are more overpowering than the elite teams in the Eastern Conference. Isiah Thomas and company physically battled their way through the first quarter, but still came out six points down, and the Clippers simply built on their lead during the rest of the game. Thomas chased down Chris Paul in transition for a highlight block, but it did not get any prettier than that for his team. The Clippers bench proved to be the difference in the game, as the starters failed to provide much offense. Jamal Crawford, Jeff Green, Wesley Johnson and Austin Rivers all finished in double figures, while Chris Paul dished out 14 assists and DeAndre Jordan commanded the paint and added 13 rebounds. Shot selection was key for the bench roles, as Los Angeles drained 52 percent of their shots and dished out 29 assists. Paulâ€™s assist total matched that of the entire Celtics team. Isiah Thomas found success attacking the rim and did most of his damage from the free throw line. The all - star point guard finished with 24 points to lead all scorers (5 - of - 14 FG, 12 - of - 13 FT) and two assists. Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart were the only other Celtics to join Thomas in double figures, which was unsurprising given the defensive effort and size they were matched up against. Boston shot a lowly 35 percent from the field and got very little production from their bench. The Clippers will visit the Minnesota Timberwolves (25 - 49) on Wednesday, while the Celtics will head north to take on the Portland Trail Blazers (39 - 36) on Thursday.
